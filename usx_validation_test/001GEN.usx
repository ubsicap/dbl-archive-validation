  <para style="ip">The name <char style="bk">Genesis</char> means “origin.” The book tells about the creation of the universe, the origin of human beings, the beginning of sin and suffering in the world, and about God's way of dealing with people. Genesis can be divided into two main parts:</para>
  <para style="ip">1) <char style="it">Chapters 1—11</char> The creation of the world and the early history of the human race. Here are the accounts of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, and the Tower of Babylon.</para>
  <para style="ip">2) <char style="it">Chapters 12—50</char> The history of the early ancestors of the Israelites. The first is Abraham, who was notable for his faith and his obedience to God. Then follow the stories of his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob (also called Israel), and of Jacob's twelve sons, the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel. Special attention is given to one of the sons, Joseph, and the events that brought Jacob and his other sons with their families to live in Egypt.</para>
  <para style="ip">While this book tells stories about people, it is first and foremost an account of what God has done. It begins with the affirmation that God created the universe, and it ends with a promise that God will continue to show his concern for his people. Throughout the book the main character is God, who judges and punishes those who do wrong, leads and helps his people, and shapes their history. This ancient book was written to record the story of a people's faith and to help keep that faith alive.</para>

    <verse number="25" style="v" sid="GEN 30:25" />After the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me go, so that I can return home. <verse eid="GEN 30:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="GEN 30:26" />Give me my wives and children that I have earned by working for you, and I will leave.

  <para style="p" vid="GEN 30:31">Jacob answered, “I don't want any wages. I will continue to take care of your flocks if you agree to this suggestion: <verse eid="GEN 30:31" /><verse number="32" style="v" sid="GEN 30:32" />Let me go through all your flocks today and take every black lamb <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">30.32: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">every black lamb; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">every spotted and speckled lamb, and every black lamb.</char></note> and every spotted or speckled young goat. That is all the wages I want. <verse eid="GEN 30:32" /><verse number="33" style="v" sid="GEN 30:33" />In the future you can easily find out if I have been honest. When you come to check up on my wages, if I have any goat that isn't speckled or spotted or any sheep that isn't black, you will know that it has been stolen.”<verse eid="GEN 30:33" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="34" style="v" sid="GEN 30:34" />Laban answered, “Agreed. We will do as you suggest.” <verse eid="GEN 30:34" /><verse number="35" style="v" sid="GEN 30:35" />But that day Laban removed the male goats that had stripes or spots and all the females that were speckled and spotted or which had white on them; he also removed all the black sheep. He put his sons in charge of them, <verse eid="GEN 30:35" /><verse number="36" style="v" sid="GEN 30:36" />and then went away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks.<verse eid="GEN 30:36" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" sid="GEN 30:37" />Jacob got green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them. <verse eid="GEN 30:37" /><verse number="38" style="v" sid="GEN 30:38" />He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink. <verse eid="GEN 30:38" /><verse number="39" style="v" sid="GEN 30:39" />So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.<verse eid="GEN 30:39" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="40" style="v" sid="GEN 30:40" />Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban's flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban's.<verse eid="GEN 30:40" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="41" style="v" sid="GEN 30:41" />When the healthy animals were mating, Jacob put the branches in front of them at the drinking troughs, so that they would breed among the branches. <verse eid="GEN 30:41" /><verse number="42" style="v" sid="GEN 30:42" />But he did not put the branches in front of the weak animals. Soon Laban had all the weak animals, and Jacob all the healthy ones. <verse eid="GEN 30:42" /><verse number="43" style="v" sid="GEN 30:43" />In this way Jacob became very wealthy. He had many flocks, slaves, camels, and donkeys.<verse eid="GEN 30:43" /></para>

He got all his wealth from what our father owned.” <verse eid="GEN 31:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GEN 31:2" />He also saw that Laban was no longer as friendly as he had been earlier. <verse eid="GEN 31:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GEN 31:3" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to him, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="GEN 31:4" />So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where his flocks were. <verse eid="GEN 31:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GEN 31:5" />He said to them, “I have noticed that your father is not as friendly toward me as he used to be; but my father's God has been with me. <verse eid="GEN 31:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="GEN 31:6" />You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength. <verse eid="GEN 31:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GEN 31:7" />Yet he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not let him harm me. <verse eid="GEN 31:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GEN 31:8" />Whenever Laban said, ‘The speckled goats shall be your wages,’ all the flocks produced speckled young.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="GEN 31:14" />Rachel and Leah answered Jacob, “There is nothing left for us to inherit from our father. <verse eid="GEN 31:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="GEN 31:15" />He treats us like foreigners. He sold us, and now he has spent all the money he was paid for us. <verse eid="GEN 31:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GEN 31:16" />All this wealth which God has taken from our father belongs to us and to our children.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17-18" style="v" sid="GEN 31:17-18" />So Jacob got ready to go back to his father in the land of Canaan.

  <para style="s1">Laban Pursues Jacob</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" sid="GEN 31:22" />Three days later Laban was told that Jacob had fled. <verse eid="GEN 31:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="GEN 31:23" />He took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. <verse eid="GEN 31:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="GEN 31:24" />In a dream that night God came to Laban and said to him, “Be careful not to threaten Jacob in any way.” <verse eid="GEN 31:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="GEN 31:25" />Jacob had set up his camp on a mountain, and Laban set up his camp with his relatives in the hill country of Gilead.<verse eid="GEN 31:25" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" sid="GEN 31:26" />Laban said to Jacob, “Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war? <verse eid="GEN 31:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="GEN 31:27" />Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps. <verse eid="GEN 31:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="GEN 31:28" />You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye. That was a foolish thing to do! <verse eid="GEN 31:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="GEN 31:29" />I have the power to do you harm, but last night the God of your father warned me not to threaten you in any way. <verse eid="GEN 31:29" /><verse number="30" style="v" sid="GEN 31:30" />I know that you left because you were so anxious to get back home, but why did you steal my household gods?”<verse eid="GEN 31:30" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" sid="GEN 31:31" />Jacob answered, “I was afraid, because I thought that you might take your daughters away from me. <verse eid="GEN 31:31" /><verse number="32" style="v" sid="GEN 31:32" />But if you find that anyone here has your gods, he will be put to death.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="33" style="v" sid="GEN 31:33" />Laban went and searched Jacob's tent; then he went into Leah's tent, and the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find his gods. Then he went into Rachel's tent. <verse eid="GEN 31:33" /><verse number="34" style="v" sid="GEN 31:34" />Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in a camel's saddlebag and was sitting on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but did not find them. <verse eid="GEN 31:34" /><verse number="35" style="v" sid="GEN 31:35" />Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I am not able to stand up in your presence; I am having my monthly period.” Laban searched but did not find his household gods.<verse eid="GEN 31:35" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" sid="GEN 31:36" />Then Jacob lost his temper. “What crime have I committed?” he asked angrily. “What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down? <verse eid="GEN 31:36" /><verse number="37" style="v" sid="GEN 31:37" />Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it, and let them decide which one of us is right. <verse eid="GEN 31:37" /><verse number="38" style="v" sid="GEN 31:38" />I have been with you now for twenty years; your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce, and I have not eaten any rams from your flocks. <verse eid="GEN 31:38" /><verse number="39" style="v" sid="GEN 31:39" />Whenever a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always bore the loss myself. I didn't take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night. <verse eid="GEN 31:39" /><verse number="40" style="v" sid="GEN 31:40" />Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep. <verse eid="GEN 31:40" /><verse number="41" style="v" sid="GEN 31:41" />It was like that for the whole twenty years I was with you. For fourteen years I worked to win your two daughters—and six years for your flocks. And even then, you changed my wages ten times. <verse eid="GEN 31:41" /><verse number="42" style="v" sid="GEN 31:42" />If the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac, had not been with me, you would have already sent me away empty-handed.

  <para style="s1">The Agreement between Jacob and Laban</para>
  <para style="p">

In fact, everything you see here belongs to me. But since I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children, <verse eid="GEN 31:43" /><verse number="44" style="v" sid="GEN 31:44" />I am ready to make an agreement with you.

    <verse number="45" style="v" sid="GEN 31:45" />So Jacob got a stone and set it up as a memorial. <verse eid="GEN 31:45" /><verse number="46" style="v" sid="GEN 31:46" />He told his men to gather some rocks and pile them up.

After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. <verse eid="GEN 31:54" /><verse number="55" style="v" sid="GEN 31:55" />Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters good-bye, and left to go back home.<verse eid="GEN 31:55" /></para>
