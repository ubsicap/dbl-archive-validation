    <char style="bk">The First Book of Kings</char> continues the history of the Israelite monarchy begun in the books of <char style="bk">Samuel</char> It may be divided into three parts: (1) The succession of Solomon as king of Israel and Judah, and the death of his father David. (2) The reign and achievements of Solomon. Especially noteworthy is the building of the Temple in Jerusalem. (3) The division of the nation into the northern and southern kingdoms, and the stories of the kings who ruled them down to the middle of the ninth century <char style="sc">b.c.</char></para>
  <para style="ip">In the two books of <char style="bk">Kings</char> each ruler is judged according to his loyalty to God, and national success is seen as depending on this loyalty, while idolatry and disobedience lead to disaster. The kings of the northern kingdom all fail the test, while the record of Judah's kings is mixed.</para>
  <para style="ip">Prominent in <char style="bk">First Kings</char> are the prophets of the Lord, those courageous spokesmen for God who warned the people not to worship idols and not to disobey God. Especially notable is Elijah and the story of his contest with the priests of Baal (chapter 18).</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />King David was now a very old man, and although his servants covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. <verse number="2" style="v" />So his officials said to him, “Your Majesty, let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.” <verse number="3" style="v" />A search was made all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king. <verse number="4" style="v" />She was very beautiful, and waited on the king and took care of him, but he did not have intercourse with her.</para>

    </note> Now that Absalom was dead, Adonijah, the son of David and Haggith, was the oldest surviving son. He was a very handsome man. David had never reprimanded him about anything, and he was ambitious to be king. He provided for himself chariots, horses, and an escort of fifty men. <verse number="7" style="v" />He talked with Joab (whose mother was Zeruiah) and with Abiathar the priest, and they agreed to support his cause. <verse number="8" style="v" />But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's bodyguards were not on Adonijah's side.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />One day Adonijah offered a sacrifice of sheep, bulls, and fattened calves at Snake Rock, near the spring of Enrogel. He invited the other sons of King David and the king's officials who were from Judah to come to this sacrificial feast, <verse number="10" style="v" />but he did not invite his half brother Solomon or Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king's bodyguards.</para>

    </note> Then Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and asked her, “Haven't you heard that Haggith's son Adonijah has made himself king? And King David doesn't know anything about it! <verse number="12" style="v" />If you want to save your life and the life of your son Solomon, I would advise you to <verse number="13" style="v" />go at once to King David and ask him, ‘Your Majesty, didn't you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king? How is it, then, that Adonijah has become king?’” <verse number="14" style="v" />And Nathan added, “Then, while you are still talking with King David, I will come in and confirm your story.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, was taking care of him. <verse number="16" style="v" />Bathsheba bowed low before the king, and he asked, “What do you want?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />She answered, “Your Majesty, you made me a solemn promise in the name of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God that my son Solomon would be king after you. <verse number="18" style="v" />But Adonijah has already become king, and you don't know anything about it. <verse number="19" style="v" />He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves, and he invited your sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of your army to the feast, but he did not invite your son Solomon. <verse number="20" style="v" />Your Majesty, all the people of Israel are looking to you to tell them who is to succeed you as king. <verse number="21" style="v" />If you don't, as soon as you are dead, my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />She was still speaking, when Nathan arrived at the palace. <verse number="23" style="v" />The king was told that the prophet was there, and Nathan went in and bowed low before the king. <verse number="24" style="v" />Then he said, “Your Majesty, have you announced that Adonijah would succeed you as king? <verse number="25" style="v" />This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited all your sons, Joab the commander of your army, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.25: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Joab the commander of your army; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">your army commanders.</char></note> and Abiathar the priest, and right now they are feasting with him and shouting, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ <verse number="26" style="v" />But he did not invite me, sir, or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon. <verse number="27" style="v" />Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />King David said, “Ask Bathsheba to come back in”—and she came and stood before him. <verse number="29" style="v" />Then he said to her, “I promise you by the living <char style="nd">Lord</char>, who has rescued me from all my troubles, <verse number="30" style="v" />that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, that your son Solomon would succeed me as king.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />Bathsheba bowed low and said, “May my lord the king live forever!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="32" style="v" />Then King David sent for Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah. When they came in, <verse number="33" style="v" />he said to them, “Take my court officials with you; have my son Solomon ride my own mule, and escort him down to Gihon Spring, <verse number="34" style="v" />where Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ <verse number="35" style="v" />Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, because he is the one I have chosen to be the ruler of Israel and Judah.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" />“It shall be done,” answered Benaiah, “and may the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God confirm it! <verse number="37" style="v" />As the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has been with Your Majesty, may he also be with Solomon and make his reign even more prosperous than yours.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="38" style="v" />So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring. <verse number="39" style="v" />Zadok took the container of olive oil which he had brought from the Tent of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s presence, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” <verse number="40" style="v" />Then they all followed him back, shouting for joy and playing flutes, making enough noise to shake the ground.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="41" style="v" />As Adonijah and all his guests were finishing the feast, they heard the noise. And when Joab heard the trumpet, he asked, “What's the meaning of all that noise in the city?” <verse number="42" style="v" />Before he finished speaking, Jonathan, the son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. “Come on in,” Adonijah said. “You're a good man—you must be bringing good news.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="43" style="v" />“I'm afraid not,” Jonathan answered. “His Majesty King David has made Solomon king. <verse number="44" style="v" />He sent Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards to escort him. They had him ride on the king's mule, <verse number="45" style="v" />and Zadok and Nathan anointed him as king at Gihon Spring. Then they went into the city, shouting for joy, and the people are now in an uproar. That's the noise you just heard. <verse number="46" style="v" />Solomon is now the king. <verse number="47" style="v" />What is more, the court officials went in to pay their respects to His Majesty King David and said, ‘May your God make Solomon even more famous than you, and may Solomon's reign be even more prosperous than yours.’ Then King David bowed in worship on his bed <verse number="48" style="v" />and prayed, ‘Let us praise the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, who has today made one of my descendants succeed me as king, and has let me live to see it!’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="49" style="v" />Then Adonijah's guests were afraid, and they all got up and left, each going his own way. <verse number="50" style="v" />Adonijah, in great fear of Solomon, went to the Tent of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s presence and took hold of the corners of the altar. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.50: </char><char style="fk" closed="false">corners of the altar: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Small projections at the four corners of the altar that looked like horns.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="52" style="v" />Solomon replied, “If he is loyal, not even a hair on his head will be touched; but if he is not, he will die.” <verse number="53" style="v" />King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar. Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him, and the king said to him, “You may go home.”</para>

  <para style="s">David's Last Instructions to Solomon</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />When David was about to die, he called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions: <verse number="2" style="v" />“My time to die has come. Be confident and determined, <verse number="3" style="v" />and do what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God orders you to do.
