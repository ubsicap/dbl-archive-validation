    <char style="bk">The Second Book of the Maccabees</char> is a condensation of a five-volume history by Jason of Cyrene. The book reports events in Jewish history from the time of the High Priest, Onias the Third (about 180 <char style="sc">b.c.</char>), to the death of Nicanor (161 <char style="sc">b.c.</char>), and parallels in part the events described in the early chapters of <char style="bk">1 Maccabees</char> There is a strong emphasis on loyalty to the law and on God's reward to martyrs who die for their faith.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />“On the twenty-fifth day of the month of Kislev we will celebrate the Festival of Rededication just as we celebrate the Festival of Shelters. We thought it important to remind you of this, so that you too may celebrate this festival. In this way you will remember how fire appeared when Nehemiah offered sacrifices after he had rebuilt the Temple and the altar. <verse number="19" style="v" />At the time when our ancestors were being taken to exile in Persia, a few devout priests took some fire from the altar and secretly hid it in the bottom of a dry cistern. They hid the fire so well that no one ever discovered it. <verse number="20" style="v" />Years later, when it pleased God, the Persian emperor sent Nehemiah back to Jerusalem, and Nehemiah told the descendants of those priests to find the fire. They reported to us that they had found no fire but only some oily liquid. Nehemiah then told them to scoop some up and bring it to him. <verse number="21" style="v" />When everything for the sacrifice had been placed on the altar, he told the priests to pour the liquid over both the wood and the sacrifice. <verse number="22" style="v" />After this was done and some time had passed, the sun appeared from behind the clouds, and suddenly everything on the altar burst into flames. Everyone looked on in amazement. <verse number="23" style="v" />Then, while the fire was consuming the sacrifice, Jonathan the High Priest led the people in prayer, and Nehemiah and all the people responded.</para>
  <para style="s">Nehemiah's Prayer</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />“Nehemiah's prayer went something like this: ‘Lord God, Creator of all things, you are awesome and strong, yet merciful and just. You alone are king. No one but you is kind; <verse number="25" style="v" />no one but you is gracious and just. You are almighty and eternal, forever ready to rescue Israel from trouble. You chose our ancestors to be your own special people. <verse number="26" style="v" />Accept this sacrifice which we offer on behalf of all Israel; protect your chosen people and make us holy. <verse number="27" style="v" />Free those who are slaves in foreign lands and gather together our scattered people. Have mercy on our people, who are mistreated and despised, so that all other nations will know that you are our God. <verse number="28" style="v" />Punish the brutal and arrogant people who have oppressed us, <verse number="29" style="v" />and then establish your people in your holy land, as Moses said you would.’</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="30" style="v" />“Then the priests sang hymns. <verse number="31" style="v" />After the sacrifices had been consumed, Nehemiah gave orders for the rest of the liquid to be poured over some large stones. <verse number="32" style="v" />Immediately a fire blazed up, but it was extinguished by a flame from the fire on the altar.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="33" style="v" />“News of what had happened spread everywhere. The Persian emperor heard that a liquid had been found in the place where the priests had hidden the altar fire, just before they were taken into exile. He also heard that Nehemiah and his friends had used this liquid to burn the sacrifice on the altar. <verse number="34" style="v" />When the emperor investigated the matter and found out that this was true, he had the area fenced off and made into a shrine. <verse number="35" style="v" />It became a substantial source of income for him, and he used the money for gifts to anyone who was in his good favor. <verse number="36" style="v" />Nehemiah and his friends called the liquid <char style="it">nephthar</char> which means ‘purification,’ but most people call it ‘naphtha.’</para>

  <para style="s">Author's Preface</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Jason of Cyrene has recorded in five volumes the story of Judas Maccabeus and his brothers, the purification of the great Temple, and the dedication of its altar. <verse number="20" style="v" />He has described the battles with Antiochus Epiphanes and with his son Eupator, <verse number="21" style="v" />and he has told of the heavenly visions that appeared to those who fought bravely and enthusiastically to defend Judaism. Our forces were few in number, but they plundered the entire country and routed the heathen forces. <verse number="22" style="v" />They recaptured the Temple famous throughout the world, liberated Jerusalem, and restored the laws that were in danger of being abolished. They were able to do all these things because the Lord was merciful and kind to them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />I will now try to summarize in a single book the five volumes written by Jason. <verse number="24" style="v" />The number of details and the bulk of material can be overwhelming for anyone who wants to read an account of the events. <verse number="25" style="v" />But I have attempted to simplify it for all readers; those who read for sheer pleasure will find enjoyment and those who want to memorize the facts will not find it difficult. <verse number="26" style="v" />Writing such a summary is a difficult task, demanding hard work and sleepless nights. <verse number="27" style="v" />It is as difficult as preparing a banquet that people of different tastes will enjoy. But I am happy to undergo this hardship in order to please my readers. <verse number="28" style="v" />I will leave the matter of details to the original author and attempt to give only a summary of the events. <verse number="29" style="v" />I am not the builder of a new house who is concerned with every detail of the structure, but simply a painter whose only concern is to make the house look attractive. <verse number="30" style="v" />The historian must master his subject, examine every detail, and then explain it carefully, <verse number="31" style="v" />but whoever is merely writing a summary should be permitted to give a brief account without going into a detailed discussion. <verse number="32" style="v" />So then, without any further comment, I will begin my story. It would be foolish to write such a long introduction that the story itself would have to be cut short.</para>

  <para style="s">The Argument between Onias and Simon</para>

Simon went to him <verse number="6" style="v" />and said that there was so much money in the Temple treasury that it could not be counted, and since the money was not needed for sacrifices, it might as well be placed under the king's control.</para>
  <para style="s">Heliodorus Is Sent to Jerusalem</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />When Apollonius met with the king, he told him about the money, and the king ordered Heliodorus, his chief minister, to get it for him. <verse number="8" style="v" />Heliodorus set out at once on his mission, but he claimed that he was only making a tour of inspection of the cities of Greater Syria. <verse number="9" style="v" />After he had arrived in Jerusalem and had been warmly received by the High Priest, he explained the real reason for his visit and asked if what he had been told was true. <verse number="10-11" style="v" />The High Priest then stated that Simon, that devil of a man, had not been telling the truth. There was indeed some money in the Temple treasury, but part of it was set aside for widows and orphans and part of it belonged to Hyrcanus son of Tobias, a very important man. He also pointed out that the total amount was only 30,000 pounds of silver and 15,000 pounds of gold. <verse number="12" style="v" />He added that it was absolutely impossible that anyone should be permitted to take the money of those people who had placed their trust in the sanctity and safety of this world-famous Temple.</para>
  <para style="s">Heliodorus Plans to Enter the Temple</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />But Heliodorus insisted that the money should be taken for the royal treasury, as the king had ordered. <verse number="14" style="v" />So he set a day and went into the Temple to supervise the counting of the money. This caused an uproar throughout the entire city. <verse number="15" style="v" />Priests, wearing their priestly robes, threw themselves face downward before the altar and begged God to keep the money safe, since he had given the laws designed to protect the money that people deposited in the Temple. <verse number="16" style="v" />It was heartbreaking to see the High Priest. His face turned pale, revealing the agony of his soul, <verse number="17" style="v" />and his body was trembling with fear, reflecting the pain in his heart. <verse number="18" style="v" />People ran from their houses to join together in prayer that the Temple might not be defiled. <verse number="19" style="v" />Women, wearing nothing but skirts of sackcloth, crowded the streets. Young girls whose parents had never allowed them to be seen in public ran to the gates or to the walls of the city, or just stared out of their windows. <verse number="20" style="v" />But wherever they went, they lifted their hands to God in prayer. <verse number="21" style="v" />What a pitiful sight it was to see the High Priest in such great agony and frustration and to see everyone in the city confused and lying face down on the ground.</para>
  <para style="s">The Lord Protects His Temple</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />While everyone was begging the Lord Almighty to protect the money that had been entrusted to his care, <verse number="23" style="v" />Heliodorus went on with his plan. <verse number="24" style="v" />But at the very moment that he and his bodyguards arrived at the treasury, the Lord of all supernatural powers caused such a vision to appear that everyone who had dared to enter with Heliodorus was panic-stricken and weak with fear at this display of the Lord's power. <verse number="25" style="v" />In the vision they saw a horse and a rider. The horse had a richly decorated bridle, and its rider, dressed in gold armor, was frightening. Suddenly the horse rushed at Heliodorus, then reared up and struck at him with its hoofs. <verse number="26" style="v" />Heliodorus also saw two unusually strong and handsome young men, wearing very fine clothes. They stood on either side of him and beat him unmercifully. <verse number="27" style="v" />He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, and his men put him on a stretcher <verse number="28" style="v" />and carried him out. Only a moment earlier this man had entered the treasury with a large group of men, including all his bodyguards, but now he was being carried away helpless. So they all <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.28: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">they all; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">some manuscripts have </char><char style="fq" closed="false">he.</char></note> openly acknowledged the mighty power of God.</para>
  <para style="s">Onias Prays for Heliodorus' Recovery</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />Heliodorus lay there unable to speak and without hope of recovery from this demonstration of God's power. <verse number="30" style="v" />But the Jews praised Almighty God because he had miraculously protected his Temple and had brought great happiness where only minutes before there had been fear and confusion. <verse number="31" style="v" />Some of Heliodorus' friends quickly asked Onias the High Priest to pray that the Most High would spare the life of this man who was at the point of death. <verse number="32" style="v" />So the High Priest offered a sacrifice in the hope that God would save Heliodorus, for he did not want the king to think that the Jews had done this to the man he had sent. <verse number="33" style="v" />While Onias was offering the sacrifice, the two young men, wearing the same clothes as before, again appeared to Heliodorus and said, “Be grateful to the High Priest; the Lord has spared your life because of him. <verse number="34" style="v" />Remember that it was the Lord of heaven who punished you. Now go and tell everyone of his great power.” When they had said this, they disappeared.</para>
  <para style="s">Heliodorus Praises God</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="35" style="v" />So Heliodorus offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made many promises, because the Lord had spared his life. Then he said good-bye to Onias and returned with his army to the king. <verse number="36" style="v" />There he told everyone what the Lord, the most powerful of all gods, had done.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" />When the king asked Heliodorus who would be the best man to send on the next mission to Jerusalem, Heliodorus replied, <verse number="38" style="v" />“If you have an enemy or know of someone plotting against your government, send him. He will come back badly beaten, if he comes back at all, for some strange power from God is at work there. <verse number="39" style="v" />The God of heaven watches over the Temple; he strikes down and destroys anyone who comes to harm it.” <verse number="40" style="v" />That is the story of how the Temple treasury was protected from Heliodorus.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="s">Simon Accuses Onias</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />But Simon (mentioned earlier as the one who informed Apollonius about the money and brought trouble on the nation) also lied about Onias, claiming that he was responsible for the attack on Heliodorus and for the difficulties that followed. <verse number="2" style="v" />He dared to accuse Onias of plotting against the government—Onias who not only had made donations to Jerusalem and had protected the Temple, but who was eager to see that all our laws were obeyed. <verse number="3-4" style="v" />Apollonius son of Menestheus, the governor of Greater Syria, encouraged Simon in every evil thing he did, and Simon's opposition finally grew so strong that one of his trusted followers committed several murders. Onias realized how dangerous the situation had become, <verse number="5" style="v" />so he went to the king, not for the purpose of making accusations against his own people, but for the common good of all Jews, both in their private and public lives. <verse number="6" style="v" />He realized that without the king's cooperation there was no hope for peace, and Simon would keep on with his foolishness.</para>

    <verse number="10" style="v" />The king gave his approval, and just as soon as Jason took over the office of High Priest, he made the people of Jerusalem change to the Greek way of life. <verse number="11" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4.11: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Macc 8.17.</char></note> He began by abolishing the favors that John had secured for the Jews from previous Syrian kings. (John was the father of the Eupolemus who later went to Rome to make an alliance and to establish ties of friendship.) Jason also did away with our Jewish customs and introduced new customs that were contrary to our Law. <verse number="12" style="v" />With great enthusiasm he built a stadium near the Temple hill and led our finest young men to adopt the Greek custom of participating in athletic events. <verse number="13" style="v" />Because of the unrivaled wickedness of Jason, that ungodly and illegitimate High Priest, the craze for the Greek way of life and for foreign customs reached such a point <verse number="14" style="v" />that even the priests lost all interest in their sacred duties. They lost interest in the Temple services and neglected the sacrifices. Just as soon as the signal was given, they would rush off to take part in the games that were forbidden by our Law. <verse number="15" style="v" />They did not care about anything their ancestors had valued; they prized only Greek honors. <verse number="16" style="v" />And this turned out to be the source of all their troubles, for the very people whose ways they admired and whose customs they tried to imitate became their enemies and oppressed them. <verse number="17" style="v" />It is a serious thing to disregard God's Law, as you will see from the following events.</para>

From Jerusalem Antiochus led his army to Phoenicia.</para>

But he possessed no other qualifications; he had the temper of a cruel tyrant and could be as fierce as a wild animal. <verse number="26" style="v" />So Jason, who had cheated his own brother out of the office of High Priest, was now forced to flee to the land of Ammon. <verse number="27" style="v" />Menelaus continued to be High Priest, but he never paid any of the money he had promised the king. <verse number="28" style="v" />However, Sostratus, the captain of the fort in Jerusalem, kept demanding the money, since it was his responsibility to collect it. So finally, the two men were summoned to appear before the king concerning the matter. <verse number="29" style="v" />Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus as acting High Priest, while Sostratus left the fort under the command of Crates, the commander of the mercenary troops from Cyprus.</para>

He had already sold some of them to the city of Tyre and to other nearby cities. <verse number="33" style="v" />When Onias heard about this, he fled for safety to a temple at Daphne near the city of Antioch and openly accused Menelaus. <verse number="34" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">4.34: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Dn 9.26.</char></note> Then Menelaus secretly persuaded Andronicus to kill Onias.

Many Gentiles felt the same way about the crime. <verse number="37" style="v" />King Antiochus was deeply grieved and was so filled with sorrow that he was moved to tears when he recalled the wisdom and self-control that Onias had shown throughout his life. <verse number="38" style="v" />Antiochus became so angry that he tore off Andronicus' royal robe, stripped him naked, and marched him around the city to the very spot where Onias had been murdered.

When word of this spread around, crowds began to gather in protest against Lysimachus. <verse number="40" style="v" />Finally, the crowds were becoming dangerous and were beginning to get out of control, so Lysimachus sent 3,000 armed men to attack them. They were led by Auranus, a man as stupid as he was old. <verse number="41" style="v" />When the Jews in the Temple courtyard realized what was happening, they picked up rocks, pieces of wood, or simply handfuls of ashes from the altar and threw them at Lysimachus and his men in the confusion. <verse number="42" style="v" />They killed a few of Lysimachus' men, wounded many of them, and all the rest ran for their lives.

So Menelaus was set free, although he had caused the trouble; but the three men, whom even the cruel Scythians would have declared innocent, were sentenced to death. <verse number="48" style="v" />The three men had spoken in defense of Jerusalem, its people, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4.48: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">its people; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">some manuscripts also have </char><char style="fq" closed="false">the surrounding villages.</char></note> and the sacred objects stolen from the Temple, but they were quickly and unjustly executed. <verse number="49" style="v" />Some of the people of Tyre, however, showed their disgust with this crime and their respect for these men by giving them a splendid funeral. <verse number="50" style="v" />Menelaus stayed on in his position because of the greed of those in power.

They drove back those stationed on the city walls and finally captured the city. Menelaus fled for safety to the fort, near the Temple hill, <verse number="6" style="v" />while Jason and his men went on slaughtering their fellow Jews without mercy. Jason did not realize that success against one's own people is the worst kind of failure. He even considered his success a victory over enemies, rather than a defeat of his own people. <verse number="7" style="v" />But Jason did not take over the government. Instead he was forced to flee once again to the territory of the Ammonites, and in the end his evil plot brought him nothing but shame and disgrace, <verse number="8" style="v" />and he died in misery. Aretas, the ruler of the Arabs, imprisoned him; he was looked upon as a criminal and despised because he had betrayed his own people; everyone was hunting for him, and he had to run from town to town. He fled to Egypt for safety, <verse number="9" style="v" />then to Greece, hoping to find refuge among the Spartans, who were related to the Jews. Finally, this man, who had forced so many others to flee from their own country, died as a fugitive in a foreign land. <verse number="10" style="v" />Jason had killed many people and left their bodies unburied, but now his own death was unmourned.

    <verse number="11" style="v" />When the news of what had happened in Jerusalem reached Antiochus, he thought the whole country of Judea was in revolt, and he became as furious as a wild animal. So he left Egypt and took Jerusalem by storm, <verse number="12" style="v" />giving his men orders to cut down without mercy everyone they met and to slaughter anyone they found hiding in the houses. <verse number="13" style="v" />They murdered everyone—men and women, boys and girls; even babies were butchered. <verse number="14" style="v" />Three days later Jerusalem had lost 80,000 people: 40,000 killed in the attack and at least that many taken away to be sold as slaves.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />But Antiochus was still not satisfied. He even dared to enter the holiest Temple in all the world, guided by Menelaus, who had become a traitor both to his religion and to his people. <verse number="16" style="v" />With his filthy and unholy hands, Antiochus swept away the sacred objects of worship and the gifts which other kings had given to increase the glory and honor of the Temple. <verse number="17" style="v" />He was so thrilled with his conquest that he did not realize that the Lord had let his holy Temple be defiled because the sin of the people of Jerusalem had made him angry for a while. <verse number="18" style="v" />If the people of Jerusalem had not been involved in so many sins, Antiochus would have been punished immediately and prevented from taking such a foolish action. He would have suffered the same fate as Heliodorus, who was sent by King Seleucus to inspect the treasury. <verse number="19" style="v" />But the Lord did not choose his people for the sake of his Temple; he established his Temple for the sake of his people. <verse number="20" style="v" />So the Temple shared in the people's suffering but also later shared in their prosperity. The Lord abandoned it when he became angry, but restored it when his anger had cooled down.</para>

In addition to these, there was Menelaus, who mistreated his fellow Jews far worse than the governors did. Antiochus hated the Jews so much <verse number="24" style="v" />that he sent an army of 22,000 mercenary troops from Mysia to Jerusalem under the command of a man named Apollonius, with orders to kill every man in the city and to sell the women and boys as slaves. <verse number="25" style="v" />Apollonius arrived in Jerusalem, pretending to be on a peace mission.

Ptolemy also appointed Gorgias, a general of wide military experience, to go with him. <verse number="10" style="v" />King Antiochus owed the Romans 150,000 pounds of silver; Nicanor planned to pay off the debt by selling Jewish prisoners of war as slaves.</para>

    <verse number="3" style="v" />About this time, the people of Joppa did a cruel thing to the Jews of their city. They pretended to be friendly to the Jews and invited them and their families to go sailing with them on ships they had provided. <verse number="4" style="v" />Since all the people of the town had decided to do this, the Jews suspected nothing and accepted the invitation out of a feeling of good will.

The people who lived there were a mixed population of Gentiles <verse number="14" style="v" />who relied on the strength of their walls and felt confident that they had enough food stored up to last through a siege. So they made fun of Judas and his men, shouting out insults against them and profanities against their God. <verse number="15" style="v" />But the Jews prayed to the Almighty Lord of the universe, who had torn down the walls of Jericho in the days of Joshua without using battering rams or siege weapons. Then they made a fierce attack against the wall <verse number="16" style="v" />and because it was God's will, they captured the city.

In terror they began to run wildly about and many of them were wounded by the swords of their own men. <verse number="23" style="v" />So Judas and his men pursued them as hard as they could, killing at least 30,000 of the enemy. <verse number="24" style="v" />Timothy himself was captured by the troops of Dositheus and Sosipater.

So the Jews made up their minds not to waste any time, but to make a daring attack against the enemy and bravely decide their fate in hand-to-hand combat. <verse number="18" style="v" />They were not so concerned about their own families and relatives as they were about their sacred Temple. <verse number="19" style="v" />And the people who had to stay in Jerusalem were deeply concerned about how a battle on open ground would turn out.</para>

    <verse number="20" style="v" />Everyone was waiting to see who would win the battle. The enemy troops were already moving forward, with their cavalry on each side of them, and their elephants placed in strategic positions. <verse number="21" style="v" />Judas Maccabeus looked at the huge enemy force, the variety of their weapons, and their fierce elephants. Then he raised his hands toward heaven and prayed to the Lord, who works miracles, because he knew that the Lord gives victory to those who deserve it, not to those who have a strong army. <verse number="22" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">15.22: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">2 K 19.35.</char></note> Judas said: “Lord, when Hezekiah was king of Judah, you sent your angel, who killed 185,000 of King Sennacherib's men. <verse number="23" style="v" />Now once again, Lord of heaven, send your good angel to make our enemies shake and tremble with fear. <verse number="24" style="v" />With your great power, destroy these people who have slandered you and have come out to attack your chosen people.” So Judas ended his prayer.</para>

    </note> Nicanor and his army moved forward to the sound of trumpets and battle songs, <verse number="26" style="v" />but Judas and his men went into battle calling on God for help. <verse number="27" style="v" />So by fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, the Jews killed more than 35,000 of the enemy. How grateful they were for the help they had received from God! <verse number="28" style="v" />When the battle was over and they were going home celebrating their victory, they noticed Nicanor in full armor lying dead on the battlefield. <verse number="29" style="v" />Then with loud shouts they praised the Lord in their native language.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" />That is how things turned out for Nicanor. The city of Jerusalem remained in the possession of the Jewish people from that time on, so I will end my story here. <verse number="38" style="v" />If it is well written and to the point, I am pleased; if it is poorly written and uninteresting, I have still done my best. <verse number="39" style="v" />We know it is unhealthy to drink wine or water alone, whereas wine mixed with water makes a delightfully tasty drink. So also a good story skillfully written gives pleasure to those who read it. With this I conclude.</para>
