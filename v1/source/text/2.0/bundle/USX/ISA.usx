    <char style="bk">The Book of Isaiah</char> is named for a great prophet who lived in Jerusalem in the latter half of the eighth century <char style="sc">b.c.</char> This book may be divided into three principal parts:</para>
  <para style="ip">1) <char style="it">Chapters 1—39</char> come from a time when Judah, the southern kingdom, was threatened by a powerful neighbor, Assyria. Isaiah saw that the real threat to the life of Judah was not simply the might of Assyria, but the nation's own sin and disobedience toward God, and their lack of trust in him. In vivid words and actions the prophet called the people and their leaders to a life of righteousness and justice, and warned that failure to listen to God would bring doom and destruction. Isaiah also foretold a time of world-wide peace and the coming of a descendant of David who would be the ideal king.</para>
  <para style="ip">2) <char style="it">Chapters 40—55</char> speak to a time when many of the people of Judah were in exile in Babylon, crushed and without hope. The prophet proclaimed that God would set his people free and take them home to Jerusalem to begin a new life. A notable theme of these chapters is that God is the Lord of history, and his plan for his people includes their mission to all nations, who will be blessed through Israel. The passages about “the Servant of the Lord” are among the best known of the Old Testament.</para>
  <para style="ip">3) <char style="it">Chapters 56—66</char> for the most part speak to a time when people were back in Jerusalem and needed reassurance that God was going to fulfill his promises to the nation. Concern is expressed for righteousness and justice, and also for Sabbath observance, sacrifice, and prayer. A notable passage is 61.1-2, words used by Jesus at the beginning of his ministry to express his calling.</para>

  <para style="s">God Reprimands His People</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said, “Earth and sky, listen to what I am saying! The children I brought up have rebelled against me. <verse number="3" style="v" />Cattle know who owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />You are doomed, you sinful nation, you corrupt and evil people! Your sins drag you down! You have rejected the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the holy God of Israel, and have turned your backs on him. <verse number="5" style="v" />Why do you keep on rebelling? Do you want to be punished even more? Israel, your head is already covered with wounds, and your heart and mind are sick. <verse number="6" style="v" />From head to foot there is not a healthy spot on your body. You are covered with bruises and sores and open wounds. Your wounds have not been cleaned or bandaged. No medicine has been put on them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Your country has been devastated, and your cities have been burned to the ground. While you look on, foreigners take over your land and bring everything to ruin. <verse number="8" style="v" />Jerusalem alone is left, a city under siege—as defenseless as a guard's hut in a vineyard or a shed in a cucumber field. <verse number="9" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1.9: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Gn 19.24; Ro 9.29.</char></note> If the <char style="nd">Lord</char> Almighty had not let some of the people survive, Jerusalem would have been totally destroyed, just as Sodom and Gomorrah were.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Jerusalem, your rulers and your people are like those of Sodom and Gomorrah. Listen to what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is saying to you. Pay attention to what our God is teaching you. <verse number="11" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1.11-14: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Am 5.21,22.</char></note> He says, “Do you think I want all these sacrifices you keep offering to me? I have had more than enough of the sheep you burn as sacrifices and of the fat of your fine animals. I am tired of the blood of bulls and sheep and goats. <verse number="12" style="v" />Who asked you to bring me all this when you come to worship me? Who asked you to do all this tramping around in my Temple? <verse number="13" style="v" />It's useless to bring your offerings. I am disgusted with the smell of the incense you burn. I cannot stand your New Moon Festivals, your Sabbaths, and your religious gatherings; they are all corrupted by your sins. <verse number="14" style="v" />I hate your New Moon Festivals and holy days; they are a burden that I am tired of bearing.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />“When you lift your hands in prayer, I will not look at you. No matter how much you pray, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with blood. <verse number="16" style="v" />Wash yourselves clean. Stop all this evil that I see you doing. Yes, stop doing evil <verse number="17" style="v" />and learn to do right. See that justice is done—help those who are oppressed, give orphans their rights, and defend widows.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> says, “Now, let's settle the matter. You are stained red with sin, but I will wash you as clean as snow. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.18: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">sin, but…snow; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">sin; do you think I will wash you as clean as snow?</char></note> Although your stains are deep red, you will be as white as wool. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.18: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Although your…wool; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Your stains are deep red; do you think you will be as white as wool?</char></note> <verse number="19" style="v" />If you will only obey me, you will eat the good things the land produces. <verse number="20" style="v" />But if you defy me, you are doomed to die.

  <para style="s">The Sinful City</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />The city that once was faithful is behaving like a whore! At one time it was filled with righteous people, but now only murderers remain. <verse number="22" style="v" />Jerusalem, you were once like silver, but now you are worthless; you were like good wine, but now you are only water. <verse number="23" style="v" />Your leaders are rebels and friends of thieves; they are always accepting gifts and bribes. They never defend orphans in court or listen when widows present their case.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />So now, listen to what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> Almighty, Israel's powerful God, is saying: “I will take revenge on you, my enemies, and you will cause me no more trouble. <verse number="25" style="v" />I will take action against you. I will purify you the way metal is refined, and will remove all your impurity. <verse number="26" style="v" />I will give you rulers and advisers like those you had long ago. Then Jerusalem will be called the righteous, faithful city.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />Because the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is righteous, he will save Jerusalem and everyone there who repents. <verse number="28" style="v" />But he will crush everyone who sins and rebels against him; he will kill everyone who forsakes him.</para>
  <para style="p">

    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the fourteenth year that Hezekiah was king of Judah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. <verse number="2" style="v" />Then he ordered his chief official to go from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large military force to demand that King Hezekiah surrender. The official occupied the road where the cloth makers work, by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. <verse number="3" style="v" />Three Judeans came out to meet him: the official in charge of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah; the court secretary, Shebna; and the official in charge of the records, Joah son of Asaph. <verse number="4" style="v" />The Assyrian official told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident. <verse number="5" style="v" />He demanded, “Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might?
