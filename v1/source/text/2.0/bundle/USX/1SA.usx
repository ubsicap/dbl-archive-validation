    <char style="bk">The First Book of Samuel</char> records the transition in Israel from the period of the judges to the monarchy. This change in Israel's national life revolved mainly around three men: Samuel, the last of the great judges; Saul, Israel's first king; and David, whose early adventures before coming to power are interwoven with the accounts of Samuel and Saul.</para>
  <para style="ip">The theme of this book, like that of other historical writings in the Old Testament, is that faithfulness to God brings success, while disobedience brings disaster. This is stated clearly in the Lord's message to the priest Eli in 2.30: “I will honor those who honor me, and I will treat with contempt those who despise me.”</para>
  <para style="ip">The book records mixed feelings about the establishment of the monarchy. The Lord himself was regarded as the real king of Israel, but in response to the people's request the Lord chose a king for them. The important fact was that both the king and the people of Israel lived under the sovereignty and judgment of God (2.7-10). Under God's laws the rights of all people, rich and poor alike, were to be maintained.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />There was a man named Elkanah, from the tribe of Ephraim, who lived in the town of Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham and grandson of Elihu, and belonged to the family of Tohu, a part of the clan of Zuph. <verse number="2" style="v" />Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not. <verse number="3" style="v" />Every year Elkanah went from Ramah to worship and offer sacrifices to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="4" style="v" />Each time Elkanah offered his sacrifice, he would give one share of the meat to Peninnah and one share to each of her children. <verse number="5" style="v" />And even though he loved Hannah very much he would give her only one share, because <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.5: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">And even…because; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">To Hannah, however, he would give a special share, because he loved her very much, even though.</char></note> the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had kept her from having children. <verse number="6" style="v" />Peninnah, her rival, would torment and humiliate her, because the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had kept her childless. <verse number="7" style="v" />This went on year after year; whenever they went to the house of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, Peninnah would upset Hannah so much that she would cry and refuse to eat anything. <verse number="8" style="v" />Her husband Elkanah would ask her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why are you always so sad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?”</para>

    <verse number="9-10" style="v" />One time, after they had finished their meal in the house of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> at Shiloh, Hannah got up. She was deeply distressed, and she cried bitterly as she prayed to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>.

So Eli thought that she was drunk, <verse number="14" style="v" />and he said to her, “Stop making a drunken show of yourself Stop your drinking and sober up!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />“No, I'm not drunk, sir,” she answered. “I haven't been drinking! I am desperate, and I have been praying, pouring out my troubles to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="16" style="v" />Don't think I am a worthless woman. I have been praying like this because I'm so miserable.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />The next morning Elkanah and his family got up early, and after worshiping the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, they went back home to Ramah. Elkanah had intercourse with his wife Hannah, and the <char style="nd">Lord</char> answered her prayer. <verse number="20" style="v" />So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.

All the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices were treated like this. <verse number="15" style="v" />In addition, even before the fat was taken off and burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, “Give me some meat for the priest to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw meat.”</para>

    <verse number="23" style="v" />But David answered, “My brothers, you can't do this with what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has given us!

All must share alike: whoever stays behind with the supplies gets the same share as the one who goes into battle.” <verse number="25" style="v" />David made this a rule, and it has been followed in Israel ever since.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />The Philistines fought a battle against the Israelites on Mount Gilboa. Many Israelites were killed there, and the rest of them, including King Saul and his sons, fled. <verse number="2" style="v" />But the Philistines caught up with them and killed three of Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. <verse number="3" style="v" />The fighting was heavy around Saul, and he himself was hit by enemy arrows and badly wounded. <verse number="4" style="v" />He said to the young man carrying his weapons, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that these godless Philistines won't gloat over me and kill me.” But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it. <verse number="5" style="v" />The young man saw that Saul was dead, so he too threw himself on his own sword and died with Saul. <verse number="6" style="v" />And that is how Saul, his three sons, and the young man died; all of Saul's men died that day. <verse number="7" style="v" />When the Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and east of the Jordan River heard that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had been killed, they abandoned their towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied the towns.</para>
