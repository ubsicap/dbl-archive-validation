  <para style="ip">The prophet Ezekiel lived in exile in Babylon during the period before and after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <char style="sc">b.c.</char> His message was addressed both to the exiles in Babylonia and to the people of Jerusalem. <char style="bk">The Book of Ezekiel</char> has six principal parts: (1) God's call to Ezekiel to be a prophet. (2) Warnings to the people about God's judgment on them and about the coming fall and destruction of Jerusalem. (3) Messages from the Lord regarding his judgment upon the various nations that oppressed and misled his people. (4) Comfort for Israel after the fall of Jerusalem and the promise of a brighter future. (5) The prophecy against Gog. (6) Ezekiel's picture of a restored Temple and nation.</para>
  <para style="ip">Ezekiel was a man of deep faith and great imagination. Many of his insights came in the form of visions, and many of his messages were expressed in vivid symbolic actions. Ezekiel emphasized the need for inner renewal of the heart and spirit, and the responsibility of each individual for his own sins. He also proclaimed his hope for the renewal of the life of the nation. As a priest, as well as prophet, he had special interest in the Temple and in the need for holiness.</para>
