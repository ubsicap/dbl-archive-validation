  <para style="ip">As the good news about Jesus began to be preached and welcomed among people who were not Jews, the question arose as to whether a person must obey the Law of Moses in order to be a true Christian. Paul had argued that this was not necessary–that in fact, the only sound basis for life in Christ was faith, by which all are put right with God. But among the churches of Galatia, a Roman province in Asia Minor, there had come people who opposed Paul and claimed that one must also observe the Law of Moses in order to be right with God.</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">Paul's Letter to the Galatians</char> was written in order to bring back to true faith and practice those people who were being misled by this false teaching. Paul begins by defending his right to be called an apostle of Jesus Christ. He insists that his call to be an apostle came from God, not from any human authority, and that his mission was especially to the non-Jews. Then he develops the argument that it is by faith alone that people are put right with God. In the concluding chapters Paul shows that Christian conduct flows naturally from the love that results from faith in Christ.</para>

In a private meeting with the leaders I explained the gospel message that I preach to the Gentiles. I did not want my work in the past or in the present to be a failure. <verse number="3" style="v" />My companion Titus, even though he is Greek, was not forced to be circumcised, <verse number="4" style="v" />although some wanted it done. Pretending to be believers, these men slipped into our group as spies, in order to find out about the freedom we have through our union with Christ Jesus.

    </note> But those who seemed to be the leaders—I say this because it makes no difference to me what they were; God does not judge by outward appearances—those leaders, I say, made no new suggestions to me. <verse number="7" style="v" />On the contrary, they saw that God had given me the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the task of preaching the gospel to the Jews. <verse number="8" style="v" />For by God's power I was made an apostle to the Gentiles, just as Peter was made an apostle to the Jews. <verse number="9" style="v" />James, Peter, and John, who seemed to be the leaders, recognized that God had given me this special task; so they shook hands with Barnabas and me, as a sign that we were all partners. We agreed that Barnabas and I would work among the Gentiles and they among the Jews. <verse number="10" style="v" />All they asked was that we should remember the needy in their group, which is the very thing I have <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2.10: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">have; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">had.</char></note> been eager to do.</para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him in public, because he was clearly wrong. <verse number="12" style="v" />Before some men who had been sent by James arrived there, Peter had been eating with the Gentile believers. But after these men arrived, he drew back and would not eat with the Gentiles, because he was afraid of those who were in favor of circumcising them. <verse number="13" style="v" />The other Jewish believers also started acting like cowards along with Peter; and even Barnabas was swept along by their cowardly action. <verse number="14" style="v" />When I saw that they were not walking a straight path in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you have been living like a Gentile, not like a Jew.

    <verse number="15" style="v" />Indeed, we are Jews by birth and not “Gentile sinners,” as they are called. <verse number="16" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.16: a </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ps 143.2; Ro 3.20; </char><char style="xo" closed="false">b </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ro 3.22.</char></note> Yet we know that a person is put right with God only through faith in Jesus Christ, never by doing what the Law requires. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be put right with God through our faith in Christ, and not by doing what the Law requires. For no one is put right with God by doing what the Law requires. <verse number="17" style="v" />If, then, as we try to be put right with God by our union with Christ, we are found to be sinners, as much as the Gentiles are—does this mean that Christ is serving the cause of sin? By no means! <verse number="18" style="v" />If I start to rebuild the system of Law that I tore down, then I show myself to be someone who breaks the Law. <verse number="19" style="v" />So far as the Law is concerned, however, I am dead—killed by the Law itself—in order that I might live for God. I have been put to death with Christ on his cross, <verse number="20" style="v" />so that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. This life that I live now, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me. <verse number="21" style="v" />I refuse to reject the grace of God. But if a person is put right with God through the Law, it means that Christ died for nothing!</para>

  <para style="s">The Law and the Promise</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />My friends, I am going to use an everyday example: when two people agree on a matter and sign an agreement, no one can break it or add anything to it. <verse number="16" style="v" />Now, God made his promises to Abraham and to his descendant. The scripture does not use the plural “descendants,” meaning many people, but the singular “descendant,” meaning one person only, namely, Christ. <verse number="17" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.17: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ex 12.40.</char></note> What I mean is that God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to keep it. The Law, which was given four hundred and thirty years later, cannot break that covenant and cancel God's promise. <verse number="18" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.18: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ro 4.14.</char></note> For if God's gift depends on the Law, then it no longer depends on his promise. However, it was because of his promise that God gave that gift to Abraham.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />What, then, was the purpose of the Law? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is, and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant, to whom the promise was made. The Law was handed down by angels, with a man acting as a go-between. <verse number="20" style="v" />But a go-between is not needed when only one person is involved; and God is one. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.20: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">and God is one; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">and God acts alone.</char></note></para>
  <para style="s">The Purpose of the Law</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />Does this mean that the Law is against God's promises? No, not at all! For if human beings had received a law that could bring life, then everyone could be put right with God by obeying it. <verse number="22" style="v" />But the scripture says that the whole world is under the power of sin; and so the gift which is promised on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ is given to those who believe.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />But before the time for faith came, the Law kept us all locked up as prisoners until this coming faith should be revealed. <verse number="24" style="v" />And so the Law was in charge of us until Christ came, in order that we might then be put right with God through faith. <verse number="25" style="v" />Now that the time for faith is here, the Law is no longer in charge of us.</para>

You are outside God's grace. <verse number="5" style="v" />As for us, our hope is that God will put us right with him; and this is what we wait for by the power of God's Spirit working through our faith. <verse number="6" style="v" />For when we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor the lack of it makes any difference at all; what matters is faith that works through love.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />You were doing so well! Who made you stop obeying the truth? How did he persuade you? <verse number="8" style="v" />It was not done by God, who calls you. <verse number="9" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">5.9: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Co 5.6.</char></note> “It takes only a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise,” as they say. <verse number="10" style="v" />But I still feel confident about you. Our life in union with the Lord makes me confident that you will not take a different view and that whoever is upsetting you will be punished by God.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />But as for me, my friends, if I continue to preach that circumcision is necessary, why am I still being persecuted? If that were true, then my preaching about the cross of Christ would cause no trouble. <verse number="12" style="v" />I wish that the people who are upsetting you would go all the way; let them go on and castrate themselves!</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />As for you, my friends, you were called to be free. But do not let this freedom become an excuse for letting your physical desires control you. Instead, let love make you serve one another. <verse number="14" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">5.14: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Lv 19.18.</char></note> For the whole Law is summed up in one commandment: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” <verse number="15" style="v" />But if you act like wild animals, hurting and harming each other, then watch out, or you will completely destroy one another.</para>
  <para style="s">The Spirit and Human Nature</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />What I say is this: let the Spirit direct your lives, and you will not satisfy the desires of the human nature. <verse number="17" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">5.17: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ro 7.15-23.</char></note> For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the Spirit wants, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants. These two are enemies, and this means that you cannot do what you want to do. <verse number="18" style="v" />If the Spirit leads you, then you are not subject to the Law.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />What human nature does is quite plain. It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions; <verse number="20" style="v" />in worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; <verse number="21" style="v" />they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />But the Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <verse number="23" style="v" />humility, and self-control. There is no law against such things as these. <verse number="24" style="v" />And those who belong to Christ Jesus have put to death their human nature with all its passions and desires. <verse number="25" style="v" />The Spirit has given us life; he must also control our lives. <verse number="26" style="v" />We must not be proud or irritate one another or be jealous of one another.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />My friends, if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should set him right; but you must do it in a gentle way. And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too. <verse number="2" style="v" />Help carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will obey <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">6.2: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">you will obey; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">some manuscripts have </char><char style="fq" closed="false">obey.</char></note> the law of Christ. <verse number="3" style="v" />If you think you are something when you really are nothing, you are only deceiving yourself. <verse number="4" style="v" />You should each judge your own conduct. If it is good, then you can be proud of what you yourself have done, without having to compare it with what someone else has done. <verse number="5" style="v" />For each of you have to carry your own load.</para>

You will reap exactly what you plant. <verse number="8" style="v" />If you plant in the field of your natural desires, from it you will gather the harvest of death; if you plant in the field of the Spirit, from the Spirit you will gather the harvest of eternal life. <verse number="9" style="v" />So let us not become tired of doing good; for if we do not give up, the time will come when we will reap the harvest. <verse number="10" style="v" />So then, as often as we have the chance, we should do good to everyone, and especially to those who belong to our family in the faith.</para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />See what big letters I make as I write to you now with my own hand! <verse number="12" style="v" />The people who are trying to force you to be circumcised are the ones who want to show off and boast about external matters. They do it, however, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. <verse number="13" style="v" />Even those who practice circumcision do not obey the Law; they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you submitted to this physical ceremony. <verse number="14" style="v" />As for me, however, I will boast only about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of his cross the world is dead to me, and I am dead to the world. <verse number="15" style="v" />It does not matter at all whether or not one is circumcised; what does matter is being a new creature. <verse number="16" style="v" />As for those who follow this rule in their lives, may peace and mercy be with them—with them and with all of God's people!</para>
