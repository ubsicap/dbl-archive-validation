    <char style="bk">The Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach</char> also known as <char style="bk">Ecclesiasticus</char> was written in Hebrew by a man named Joshua (or Jesus) and was later translated into Greek by his grandson. The book includes traditional Jewish wisdom material and makes a defense of Judaism by showing that God has given true wisdom to his people. Many subjects of a religious, moral, and practical nature are presented, sometimes at length and sometimes in short proverbial sayings.</para>

  <para style="s">Foreword</para>
  <para style="p">The Law, the Prophets, and the later writers have left us a wealth of valuable teachings, and we should praise Israel for the instruction and wisdom they provide. But it is not enough that those who read them should gain understanding for themselves. Anyone who values learning should be able to help others by what he himself says and writes. That is why my grandfather Jesus devoted himself to reading the Law, the Prophets, and the other books of our ancestors. After he had mastered them, he was led to write a book of his own in order to share his wisdom and learning with others, so that anyone who shared his love for learning should have his book available as well, and be all the more able to live according to the Law.</para>
  <para style="p">Let me urge you, then, to read this book carefully and with an open mind. And please be patient in those places where, in spite of all my diligent efforts, I may not have translated some phrases very well. What was originally written in Hebrew does not always have exactly the same sense when it is translated into another language. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">0.0: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The book of Sirach was written in Hebrew, but the writer of this foreword translated it into Greek.</char></note> That is true not only of this book, but even of the Law itself, the Prophets, and the other books. The translations differ quite a bit from the original.</para>
  <para style="p">I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of King Euergetes' reign and stayed for some time. While I was there, I had the opportunity for a good deal of study and felt the necessity of translating the following book. I wanted to use all my diligence and skill to complete it and make it available for all those living in foreign lands who wish to learn and who have the strength of character to live by the Law of Moses.</para>

    </note> My child, when someone dies, you should mourn. Weep and wail to show how deeply you feel the loss. Prepare the body in the proper way, and be present at the burial. <verse number="17" style="v" />Weep bitterly and passionately; observe the proper period of mourning for the person. Mourn for a whole day or maybe two, to keep people from talking, but then pull yourself together and reconcile yourself to the loss. <verse number="18" style="v" />Grief can undermine your health and even lead to your own death. <verse number="19" style="v" />Grief lingers on after the death of a loved one, but it is not wise to let it lead you into poverty.</para>

    </note> Once, while the people were in the wilderness, an angry group of jealous outsiders conspired against Moses. These were Dathan, Abiram, and Korah with their supporters. <verse number="19" style="v" />The Lord saw what they were doing and became angry, so furious that he performed a miracle and destroyed them in a blazing fire. <verse number="20" style="v" />Then he rewarded Aaron again, giving him a special honor: the right to the offerings of the first produce, so that the priests should have enough to eat. <verse number="21" style="v" />Their food is the sacrifices offered to the Lord; the Lord gave this to Aaron and his descendants. <verse number="22" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">45.22: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Nu 18.20; Dt 12.12.</char></note> But Aaron, unlike the rest of the people, was to inherit no land, no special portion of his own.

He brought about forgiveness for Israel's sin by standing firm in brave determination when everyone else was in rebellion. <verse number="24" style="v" />And so the Lord made a covenant with him, valid for all time to come, that he should be in charge of the sanctuary and of his people, that he and his descendants should hold the office of High Priest forever. <verse number="25" style="v" />Unlike the covenant made with David son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah, where the kingship passed only from father to son, the priesthood was to pass from Aaron to all his descendants.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />When I was still young, before I started out on my travels, I boldly prayed for Wisdom. <verse number="14" style="v" />I went to the Temple and asked for her, and I will look for her as long as I live. <verse number="15" style="v" />From my blossoming youth to my ripe old age she has been my delight. I have followed directly in her path ever since I was young. <verse number="16" style="v" />I received Wisdom as soon as I began listening for her, and I have been rewarded with great knowledge. <verse number="17" style="v" />I have always been a learner and am grateful to everyone who has been my teacher. <verse number="18" style="v" />I was determined to live wisely and was devoted to the cause of goodness. I have no regrets. <verse number="19" style="v" />I fought for Wisdom and was strict in my conduct. When I prayed, I sadly confessed how far short of Wisdom I fell. <verse number="20" style="v" />But I was determined to have her, and I found her by keeping myself free from sin. I have grown in Wisdom since first I found her, and I will never be without her. <verse number="21" style="v" />Because I was driven by the desire to find her, I have been richly rewarded. <verse number="22" style="v" />The Lord gave me a gift for words, and I have used it in his praise.</para>

The opportunity is always near. <verse number="27" style="v" />See for yourselves! I have really not studied very hard, but I have found great contentment. <verse number="28" style="v" />No matter how much it costs you to get Wisdom, it will be well worth it. <verse number="29" style="v" />Be joyfully grateful for the Lord's mercy, and never be ashamed to praise him. <verse number="30" style="v" />Do your duty at the proper time, and the Lord, at the time he thinks proper, will give you your reward.</para>
