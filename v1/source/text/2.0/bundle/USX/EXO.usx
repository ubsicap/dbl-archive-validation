  <para style="ip">The name <char style="bk">Exodus</char> means “departure,” and refers to the most important event in Israel's history, which is described in this book–the departure of the people of Israel from Egypt, where they had been slaves. The book has four main parts: 1) the freeing of the Hebrews from slavery; 2) their journey to Mount Sinai; 3) God's covenant with his people at Sinai, which gave them moral, civil, and religious laws to live by; and 4) the building and furnishing of a place of worship for Israel, and laws regarding the priests and the worship of God.</para>
  <para style="ip">Above all, this book describes what God did, as he liberated his enslaved people and formed them into a nation with hope for the future.</para>
  <para style="ip">The central human figure in the book is Moses, the man whom God chose to lead his people from Egypt. The most widely known part of the book is the list of the Ten Commandments in chapter 20.</para>

    </note> Then, a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. <verse number="9" style="v" />He said to his people, “These Israelites are so numerous and strong that they are a threat to us. <verse number="10" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1.10: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ac 7.19.</char></note> In case of war they might join our enemies in order to fight against us, and might escape from <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.10: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">escape from; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">take control of.</char></note> the country. We must find some way to keep them from becoming even more numerous.” <verse number="11" style="v" />So the Egyptians put slave drivers over them to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses to serve as supply centers for the king. <verse number="12" style="v" />But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number and the farther they spread through the land. The Egyptians came to fear the Israelites <verse number="13-14" style="v" />and made their lives miserable by forcing them into cruel slavery. They made them work on their building projects and in their fields, and they had no pity on them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Then the king of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and Puah, the two midwives who helped the Hebrew women. <verse number="16" style="v" />“When you help the Hebrew women give birth,” he said to them, “kill the baby if it is a boy; but if it is a girl, let it live.” <verse number="17" style="v" />But the midwives were God-fearing and so did not obey the king; instead, they let the boys live. <verse number="18" style="v" />So the king sent for the midwives and asked them, “Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the boys live?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />They answered, “The Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they give birth easily, and their babies are born before either of us gets there.” <verse number="20-21" style="v" />Because the midwives were God-fearing, God was good to them and gave them families of their own.

She put the baby in it and then placed it in the tall grass at the edge of the river. <verse number="4" style="v" />The baby's sister stood some distance away to see what would happen to him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />The king's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her servants walked along the bank. Suddenly she noticed the basket in the tall grass and sent a slave woman to get it. <verse number="6" style="v" />The princess opened it and saw a baby boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.</para>

He said to the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you beating up a fellow Hebrew?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />The man answered, “Who made you our ruler and judge?

  <para style="p">One day, when Moses was sitting by a well, seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father's sheep and goats. <verse number="17" style="v" />But some shepherds drove Jethro's daughters away.

    <verse number="23" style="v" />Years later the king of Egypt died, but the Israelites were still groaning under their slavery and cried out for help.

    <verse number="1" style="v" />One day while Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, he led the flock across the desert and came to Sinai, the holy mountain. <verse number="2" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.2-10: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ac 7.30-34.</char></note> There the angel of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> appeared to him as a flame coming from the middle of a bush.

    <verse number="32" style="v" />All the work on the Tent of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s presence was finally completed.
