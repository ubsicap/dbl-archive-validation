    <char style="bk">The Second Book of Samuel</char> the sequel to <char style="bk">First Samuel</char> is the history of David's reign as king, first over Judah in the south (chapters 1—4) and then over the whole nation, including Israel in the north (chapters 5—24). It is a vivid account of how David, in order to extend his kingdom and consolidate his position, had to struggle with enemies within the nation as well as with foreign powers. David is shown to be a man of deep faith and devotion to God, and one who was able to win the loyalty of his people. Yet he is also shown as being sometimes ruthless and willing to commit terrible sins to serve his own desires and ambitions. But when he is confronted with his sins by the Lord's prophet Nathan, he confesses them and accepts the punishment that God sends.</para>
  <para style="ip">The life and achievements of David impressed the people of Israel so much that in later times of national distress, when they longed for another king, it was for one who would be “a son of David,” that is, a descendant of David who would be like him.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />After Saul's death David came back from his victory over the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag for two days. <verse number="2" style="v" />The next day a young man arrived from Saul's camp. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head. He went to David and bowed to the ground in respect. <verse number="3" style="v" />David asked him, “Where have you come from?”</para>

I answered, ‘Yes, sir!’ <verse number="8" style="v" />He asked who I was, and I told him that I was an Amalekite. <verse number="9" style="v" />Then he said, ‘Come here and kill me! I have been badly wounded, and I'm about to die.’ <verse number="10" style="v" />So I went up to him and killed him, because I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell.

    <verse number="11" style="v" />David tore his clothes in sorrow, and all his men did the same. <verse number="12" style="v" />They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, because so many had been killed in battle.</para>

  <para style="p">“Which one?” David asked.</para>

  <para style="s">Ishbosheth Is Made King of Israel</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />The commander of Saul's army, Abner son of Ner, had fled with Saul's son Ishbosheth across the Jordan to Mahanaim. <verse number="9" style="v" />There Abner made Ishbosheth king of the territories of Gilead, Asher, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2.9: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Asher; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Assyria.</char></note> Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin, and indeed over all Israel. <verse number="10" style="v" />He was forty years old when he was made king of Israel, and he ruled for two years.</para>
  <para style="p">But the tribe of Judah was loyal to David, <verse number="11" style="v" />and he ruled in Hebron over Judah for seven and a half years.</para>
  <para style="s">War between Israel and Judah</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Abner and the officials of Ishbosheth went from Mahanaim to the city of Gibeon. <verse number="13" style="v" />Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, and David's other officials met them at the pool, where they all sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the opposite side. <verse number="14" style="v" />Abner said to Joab, “Let's have some of the young men from each side fight an armed contest.”</para>
  <para style="p">“All right,” Joab answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />So twelve men, representing Ishbosheth and the tribe of Benjamin, fought twelve of David's men. <verse number="16" style="v" />Each man caught his opponent by the head and plunged his sword into his opponent's side, so that all twenty-four of them fell down dead together. And so that place in Gibeon is called “Field of Swords.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Then a furious battle broke out, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men. <verse number="18" style="v" />The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel, who could run as fast as a wild deer, <verse number="19" style="v" />started chasing Abner, running straight for him. <verse number="20" style="v" />Abner looked back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”</para>
  <para style="p">“Yes,” he answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />“Stop chasing me!” Abner said. “Run after one of the soldiers and take what he has.” But Asahel kept on chasing him. <verse number="22" style="v" />Once more Abner said to him, “Stop chasing me! Why force me to kill you? How could I face your brother Joab?” <verse number="23" style="v" />But Asahel would not quit; so Abner, with a backward thrust <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2.23: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Probable text </char><char style="fq" closed="false">with a backward thrust; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew unclear.</char></note> of his spear, struck him through the stomach so that the spear came out at his back. Asahel dropped to the ground dead, and everyone who came to the place where he was lying stopped and stood there.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />But Joab and Abishai started out after Abner, and at sunset they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. <verse number="25" style="v" />The men from the tribe of Benjamin gathered around Abner again and took their stand on the top of a hill. <verse number="26" style="v" />Abner called out to Joab, “Do we have to go on fighting forever? Can't you see that in the end there will be nothing but bitterness? We are your relatives. How long will it be before you order your men to stop chasing us?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />“I swear by the living God,” Joab answered, “that if you had not spoken, my men would have kept on chasing you until tomorrow morning.” <verse number="28" style="v" />Then Joab blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to stop pursuing the Israelites; and so the fighting stopped.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />Abner and his men marched through the Jordan Valley all that night; they crossed the Jordan River, and after marching all the next morning, they arrived back at Mahanaim.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="30" style="v" />When Joab gave up the chase, he gathered all his men and found that nineteen of them were missing, in addition to Asahel. <verse number="31" style="v" />David's men had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin. <verse number="32" style="v" />Joab and his men took Asahel's body and buried it in the family tomb at Bethlehem. Then they marched all night and at dawn arrived back at Hebron.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The fighting between the forces supporting Saul's family and those supporting David went on for a long time. As David became stronger and stronger, his opponents became weaker and weaker.</para>
  <para style="s">David's Sons</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The following six sons, in order of their birth, were born to David at Hebron: Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam, from Jezreel; <verse number="3" style="v" />Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel; Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; <verse number="4" style="v" />Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith; Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital; <verse number="5" style="v" />Ithream, whose mother was Eglah. All of these sons were born in Hebron.</para>
  <para style="s">Abner Joins David</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />As the fighting continued between David's forces and the forces loyal to Saul's family, Abner became more and more powerful among Saul's followers.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />One day Ishbosheth son of Saul accused Abner of sleeping with Saul's concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. <verse number="8" style="v" />This made Abner furious. “Do you think that I would betray Saul? Do you really think I'm serving Judah?” he exclaimed. “From the very first I have been loyal to the cause of your father Saul, his brothers, and his friends, and I have kept you from being defeated by David; yet today you find fault with me about a woman! <verse number="9-10" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.10: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">1 S 15.28.</char></note> The <char style="nd">Lord</char> promised David that he would take the kingdom away from Saul and his descendants and would make David king of both Israel and Judah, from one end of the country to the other. Now may God strike me dead if I don't make this come true!” <verse number="11" style="v" />Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he could not say a word.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Abner sent messengers to David, who at that time was at Hebron, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.12: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">at Hebron; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">where he (Abner) was.</char></note> to say, “Who is going to rule this land? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you win all Israel over to your side.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />“Good!” David answered. “I will make an agreement with you on one condition: you must bring Saul's daughter Michal to me when you come to see me.” <verse number="14" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.14: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">1 S 18.27.</char></note> And David also sent messengers to Ishbosheth to say, “Give me back my wife Michal. I paid a hundred Philistine foreskins in order to marry her.” <verse number="15" style="v" />So Ishbosheth had her taken from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. <verse number="16" style="v" />Paltiel followed her all the way to the town of Bahurim, crying as he went. But when Abner said, “Go back home,” he did.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Abner went to the leaders of Israel and said to them, “For a long time you have wanted David to be your king. <verse number="18" style="v" />Now here is your chance. Remember that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has said, ‘I will use my servant David to rescue my people Israel from the Philistines and from all their other enemies.’” <verse number="19" style="v" />Abner spoke also to the people of the tribe of Benjamin and then went to Hebron to tell David what the people of Benjamin and of Israel had agreed to do.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />When Abner came to David at Hebron with twenty men, David gave a feast for them. <verse number="21" style="v" />Abner told David, “I will go now and win all Israel over to Your Majesty. They will accept you as king, and then you will get what you have wanted and will rule over the whole land.” David gave Abner a guarantee of safety and sent him on his way.</para>
  <para style="s">Abner Is Murdered</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Later on Joab and David's other officials returned from a raid, bringing a large amount of loot with them. Abner, however, was no longer there at Hebron with David, because David had sent him away with a guarantee of safety. <verse number="23" style="v" />When Joab and his men arrived, he was told that Abner had come to King David and had been sent away with a guarantee of safety. <verse number="24" style="v" />So Joab went to the king and said to him, “What have you done? Abner came to you—why did you let him go like that? <verse number="25" style="v" />He came here to deceive you and to find out everything you do and everywhere you go. Surely you know that!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from Sirah Well; but David knew nothing about it. <verse number="27" style="v" />When Abner arrived in Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. And so Abner was murdered because he had killed Joab's brother Asahel. <verse number="28" style="v" />When David heard the news, he said, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> knows that my subjects and I are completely innocent of the murder of Abner. <verse number="29" style="v" />May the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a woman's work or is killed in battle or doesn't have enough to eat!” <verse number="30" style="v" />So Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge on Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.</para>
  <para style="s">Abner Is Buried</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />Then David ordered Joab and his men to tear their clothes, wear sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And at the funeral King David himself walked behind the coffin. <verse number="32" style="v" />Abner was buried at Hebron, and the king wept aloud at the grave, and so did all the people. <verse number="33" style="v" />David sang this lament for Abner:</para>

    <verse number="35" style="v" />All day long the people tried to get David to eat something, but he made a solemn promise, “May God strike me dead if I eat anything before the day is over!” <verse number="36" style="v" />They took note of this and were pleased. Indeed, everything the king did pleased the people. <verse number="37" style="v" />All of David's people and all the people in Israel understood that the king had no part in the murder of Abner. <verse number="38" style="v" />The king said to his officials, “Don't you realize that this day a great leader in Israel has died? <verse number="39" style="v" />Even though I am the king chosen by God, I feel weak today.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. <verse number="2" style="v" />King David said, “I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy.</para>
  <para style="p">When they arrived in Ammon, <verse number="3" style="v" />the Ammonite leaders said to the king, “Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the city, so that he can conquer us!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off one side of their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away. <verse number="5" style="v" />They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard about what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />The Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they hired twenty thousand Syrian soldiers from Bethrehob and Zobah, twelve thousand men from Tob, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men. <verse number="7" style="v" />David heard of it and sent Joab against them with the whole army. <verse number="8" style="v" />The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, while the others, both the Syrians and the men from Tob and Maacah, took up their position in the open countryside.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians. <verse number="10" style="v" />He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites. <verse number="11" style="v" />Joab said to him, “If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you. <verse number="12" style="v" />Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s will be done!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled. <verse number="14" style="v" />When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, and so they called all their troops together. <verse number="16" style="v" />King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians who were on the east side of the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah. <verse number="17" style="v" />When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and marched to Helam, where the Syrians took up their position facing him. The fighting began, <verse number="18" style="v" />and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry, and they wounded Shobach, the enemy commander, who died on the battlefield. <verse number="19" style="v" />When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, they made peace with them and became their subjects. And the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.</para>

    </note> The following spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, David sent out Joab with his officers and the Israelite army; they defeated the Ammonites and besieged the city of Rabbah. But David himself stayed in Jerusalem.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />One day, late in the afternoon, David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof. As he walked around up there, he saw a woman taking a bath in her house. She was very beautiful. <verse number="3" style="v" />So he sent a messenger to find out who she was, and learned that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite. <verse number="4" style="v" />David sent messengers to get her; they brought her to him and he made love to her. (She had just finished her monthly ritual of purification.) Then she went back home. <verse number="5" style="v" />Afterward she discovered that she was pregnant and sent a message to David to tell him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />David then sent a message to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. <verse number="7" style="v" />When Uriah arrived, David asked him if Joab and the troops were well, and how the fighting was going. <verse number="8" style="v" />Then he said to Uriah, “Go on home and rest a while.” Uriah left, and David had a present sent to his home. <verse number="9" style="v" />But Uriah did not go home; instead he slept at the palace gate with the king's guards. <verse number="10" style="v" />When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he asked him, “You have just returned after a long absence; why didn't you go home?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Uriah answered, “The men of Israel and Judah are away in battle, and the Covenant Box is with them; my commander Joab and his officers are camping out in the open. How could I go home, eat and drink, and sleep with my wife? By all that's sacred, I swear that I could never do such a thing!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />So David said, “Then stay here the rest of the day, and tomorrow I'll send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. <verse number="13" style="v" />David invited him to supper and got him drunk. But again that night Uriah did not go home; instead he slept on his blanket <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">11.13: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">blanket; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">cot.</char></note> in the palace guardroom.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. <verse number="15" style="v" />He wrote: “Put Uriah in the front line, where the fighting is heaviest, then retreat and let him be killed.” <verse number="16" style="v" />So while Joab was besieging the city, he sent Uriah to a place where he knew the enemy was strong. <verse number="17" style="v" />The enemy troops came out of the city and fought Joab's forces; some of David's officers were killed, and so was Uriah.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Then Joab sent a report to David telling him about the battle, <verse number="19" style="v" />and he instructed the messenger, “After you have told the king all about the battle, <verse number="20" style="v" />he may get angry and ask you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight them?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />So the messenger went to David and told him what Joab had commanded him to say. <verse number="23" style="v" />He said, “Our enemies were stronger than we were and came out of the city to fight us in the open, but we drove them back to the city gate. <verse number="24" style="v" />Then they shot arrows at us from the wall, and some of Your Majesty's officers were killed; your officer Uriah was also killed.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />David said to the messenger, “Encourage Joab and tell him not to be upset, since you never can tell who will die in battle. Tell him to launch a stronger attack on the city and capture it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />When Bathsheba heard that her husband had been killed, she mourned for him. <verse number="27" style="v" />When the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to the palace; she became his wife and bore him a son. But the <char style="nd">Lord</char> was not pleased with what David had done.</para>

    </note> The <char style="nd">Lord</char> sent the prophet Nathan to David. Nathan went to him and said, “There were two men who lived in the same town; one was rich and the other poor. <verse number="2" style="v" />The rich man had many cattle and sheep, <verse number="3" style="v" />while the poor man had only one lamb, which he had bought. He took care of it, and it grew up in his home with his children. He would feed it some of his own food, let it drink from his cup, and hold it in his lap. The lamb was like a daughter to him. <verse number="4" style="v" />One day a visitor arrived at the rich man's home. The rich man didn't want to kill one of his own animals to fix a meal for him; instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared a meal for his guest.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />David became very angry at the rich man and said, “I swear by the living <char style="nd">Lord</char> that the man who did this ought to die! <verse number="6" style="v" />For having done such a cruel thing, he must pay back four times as much as he took.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />“You are that man,” Nathan said to David. “And this is what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> God of Israel says: ‘I made you king of Israel and rescued you from Saul. <verse number="8" style="v" />I gave you his kingdom and his wives; I made you king over Israel and Judah. If this had not been enough, I would have given you twice as much. <verse number="9" style="v" />Why, then, have you disobeyed my commands? Why did you do this evil thing? You had Uriah killed in battle; you let the Ammonites kill him, and then you took his wife! <verse number="10" style="v" />Now, in every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriah's wife. <verse number="11" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">12.11,12: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">2 S 16.22.</char></note> I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble on you.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />“I have sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char>,” David said.</para>
  <para style="p">Nathan replied, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> forgives you; you will not die. <verse number="14" style="v" />But because you have shown such contempt for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> in doing this, your child will die.” <verse number="15" style="v" />Then Nathan went home.</para>
  <para style="s">David's Son Dies</para>
  <para style="p">The <char style="nd">Lord</char> caused the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David to become very sick. <verse number="16" style="v" />David prayed to God that the child would get well. He refused to eat anything, and every night he went into his room and spent the night lying on the floor. <verse number="17" style="v" />His court officials went to him and tried to make him get up, but he refused and would not eat anything with them. <verse number="18" style="v" />A week later the child died, and David's officials were afraid to tell him the news. They said, “While the child was living, David wouldn't answer us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that his child is dead? He might do himself some harm!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />When David noticed them whispering to each other, he realized that the child had died. So he asked them, “Is the child dead?”</para>
  <para style="p">“Yes, he is,” they answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />David got up from the floor, took a bath, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. Then he went and worshiped in the house of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. When he returned to the palace, he asked for food and ate it as soon as it was served. <verse number="21" style="v" />“We don't understand this,” his officials said to him. “While the child was alive, you wept for him and would not eat; but as soon as he died, you got up and ate!”</para>

    <verse number="22" style="v" />“Yes,” David answered, “I did fast and weep while he was still alive.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He had intercourse with her, and she bore a son, whom David named Solomon.

    <verse number="26" style="v" />Meanwhile Joab continued his campaign against Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, and was about to capture it. <verse number="27" style="v" />He sent messengers to David to report: “I have attacked Rabbah and have captured its water supply. <verse number="28" style="v" />Now gather the rest of your forces, attack the city and take it yourself.

  <para style="s">Amnon and Tamar</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />David's son Absalom had a beautiful unmarried sister named Tamar. Amnon, another of David's sons, fell in love with her. <verse number="2" style="v" />He was so much in love with her that he became sick, because it seemed impossible for him to have her; as a virgin, she was kept from meeting men. <verse number="3" style="v" />But he had a friend, a very shrewd man named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah. <verse number="4" style="v" />Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king's son, yet day after day I see you looking sad. What's the matter?”</para>
  <para style="p">“I'm in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom,” he answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Jonadab said to him, “Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her, and then serve it to me herself.’” <verse number="6" style="v" />So Amnon pretended that he was sick and went to bed.</para>
  <para style="p">King David went to see him, and Amnon said to him, “Please let Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her, and then serve them to me herself.”</para>

    <verse number="7" style="v" />So David sent word to Tamar in the palace: “Go to Amnon's house and fix him some food.” <verse number="8" style="v" />She went there and found him in bed. She took some dough, prepared it, and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes <verse number="9" style="v" />and emptied them out of the pan for him to eat, but he wouldn't. He said, “Send everyone away”—and they all left. <verse number="10" style="v" />Then he said to her, “Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me yourself.” She took the cakes and went over to him. <verse number="11" style="v" />As she offered them to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />“No,” she said. “Don't force me to do such a degrading thing! That's awful! <verse number="13" style="v" />How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you—you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please, speak to the king, and I'm sure that he will give me to you.” <verse number="14" style="v" />But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />On another occasion the <char style="nd">Lord</char> was angry with Israel, and he made David bring trouble on them. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to him, “Go and count the people of Israel and Judah.” <verse number="2" style="v" />So David gave orders to Joab, the commander of his army: “Go with your officers through all the tribes of Israel from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are.”</para>

    <verse number="3" style="v" />But Joab answered the king, “Your Majesty, may the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now, and may you live to see him do it. But why does Your Majesty want to do this?” <verse number="4" style="v" />But the king made Joab and his officers obey his order; they left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel.</para>

    <verse number="10" style="v" />But after David had taken the census, his conscience began to hurt, and he said to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, “I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly.”</para>

    <verse number="11-12" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Gad, David's prophet, “Go and tell David that I am giving him three choices.

    <verse number="14" style="v" />David answered, “I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people.
