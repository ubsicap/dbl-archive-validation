  <para style="ip">The book of <char style="bk">Deuteronomy</char> is organized as a series of addresses given by Moses to the people of Israel in the land of Moab, where they had stopped at the end of the long wilderness journey and were about to enter and occupy Canaan.</para>
  <para style="ip">Some of the most important matters recorded in the book are as follows: 1) Moses recalls the great events of the past forty years. He appeals to the people to remember how God has led them through the wilderness and to be obedient and loyal to God. 2) Moses reviews the Ten Commandments and emphasizes the meaning of the First Commandment, calling the people to devotion to the Lord alone. Then he reviews the various laws that are to govern Israel's life in the promised land. 3) Moses reminds the people of the meaning of God's covenant with them, and calls for them to renew their commitment to its obligations. 4) Joshua is commissioned as the next leader of God's people. After singing a song celebrating God's faithfulness, and pronouncing a blessing on the tribes of Israel, Moses dies in Moab, east of the Jordan River.</para>
  <para style="ip">The great theme of the book is that God has saved and blessed his chosen people, whom he loves; so his people are to remember this, and love and obey him, so that they may have life and continued blessing.</para>
  <para style="ip">The key verses of the book are 6.4-6, and contain the words that Jesus called the greatest of all commandments: “Love the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />In this book are the words that Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were in the Jordan Valley near Suph, between the town of Paran on one side and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab on the other. ( <verse number="2" style="v" />It takes eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea by way of the hill country of Edom.) <verse number="3" style="v" />On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after they had left Egypt, Moses told the people everything the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had commanded him to tell them. <verse number="4" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1.4: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Nu 21.21-35.</char></note> This was after the <char style="nd">Lord</char> <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.4: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">the <char style="nd">Lord</char>; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Moses.</char></note> had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in the town of Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who ruled in the towns of Ashtaroth and Edrei. <verse number="5" style="v" />It was while the people were east of the Jordan in the territory of Moab that Moses began to explain God's laws and teachings.</para>
  <para style="p">He said, <verse number="6" style="v" />“When we were at Mount Sinai, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> our God said to us, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain. <verse number="7" style="v" />Break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the surrounding regions—to the Jordan Valley, to the hill country and the lowlands, to the southern region, and to the Mediterranean coast. Go to the land of Canaan and on beyond the Lebanon Mountains as far as the great Euphrates River. <verse number="8" style="v" />All of this is the land which I, the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, promised to give to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants. Go and occupy it.’”</para>

    <verse number="9" style="v" />Moses said to the people, “While we were still at Mount Sinai, I told you, ‘The responsibility for leading you is too much for me. I can't do it alone. <verse number="10" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. <verse number="11" style="v" />May the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of your ancestors, make you increase a thousand times more and make you prosperous, as he promised! <verse number="12" style="v" />But how can I alone bear the heavy responsibility for settling your disputes? <verse number="13" style="v" />Choose some wise, understanding, and experienced men from each tribe, and I will put them in charge of you.’ <verse number="14" style="v" />And you agreed that this was a good thing to do. <verse number="15" style="v" />So I took the wise and experienced leaders you chose from your tribes, and I placed them in charge of you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten. I also appointed other officials throughout the tribes.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />“At that time I instructed them, ‘Listen to the disputes that come up among your people. Judge every dispute fairly, whether it concerns only your own people or involves foreigners who live among you. <verse number="17" style="v" />Show no partiality in your decisions; judge everyone on the same basis, no matter who they are. Do not be afraid of anyone, for the decisions you make come from God. If any case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will decide it.’ <verse number="18" style="v" />At the same time I gave you instructions for everything else you were to do.</para>
