    <char style="bk">The Second Book of Esdras</char> is primarily an apocalypse (or series of visions and revelations) that was written by an unknown Jewish author in Hebrew or Aramaic. This was translated into Greek, and an introduction and appendix of Christian origin were added. The original and the Greek translation have disappeared, and the text is now preserved primarily in Latin. The main part of the work reports seven revelations that were given to Shealtiel (identified with Ezra) and answers questions about the problem of evil, suffering, persecution, the end of the world, judgment, and the new world.</para>

But let me tell you <verse number="14" style="v" />that from the time God created the earth she has suffered as much in producing human beings for God as you did in childbirth. <verse number="15" style="v" />So keep your tears to yourself, and be brave about what has happened to you. <verse number="16" style="v" />If you will accept God's decision as just, you will get your son back at the right time, and you will receive the praise due a mother. <verse number="17" style="v" />Go back to the city and to your husband.”</para>

    <verse number="55" style="v" />“So don't be afraid. Go into the city and look at its beautiful and majestic buildings.

    </note> The second night I had a dream. I saw an eagle coming up out of the sea. It had twelve wings and three heads. <verse number="2" style="v" />As I looked, it spread out its wings over the whole world.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />I saw one of the wings on the right side rise up and govern the whole world. <verse number="13" style="v" />After its rule came to an end, it vanished so completely that it left no trace. Then the next wing rose up and governed for a long time. <verse number="14" style="v" />When its rule was coming to an end and it was about to vanish like the first wing, <verse number="15" style="v" />a voice said to it, <verse number="16" style="v" />“Listen, you have ruled the world for a long time, and I want you to hear this message before you disappear: <verse number="17" style="v" />No one after you will rule as long as you did—not even half as long.” <verse number="18" style="v" />The third wing rose up and governed as the earlier ones had done; then it also vanished. <verse number="19" style="v" />The same thing happened to all the other wings: one after the other they rose to power and then vanished.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />I kept looking, and after a while the other small wings on the right side rose up to seize power. Some of them governed briefly and quickly disappeared, <verse number="21" style="v" />while others rose up but were never able to govern. <verse number="22" style="v" />Then I noticed that the twelve large wings and two of the small wings had disappeared. <verse number="23" style="v" />Nothing was left on the eagle's body except the three sleeping heads and the six small wings. <verse number="24" style="v" />I kept watching, and suddenly two of the six small wings left the others and moved under the head on the right side, while the other four remained where they were. <verse number="25" style="v" />Then I saw that these four small wings were plotting to rise up and seize power. <verse number="26" style="v" />One of them rose up, but it quickly disappeared. <verse number="27" style="v" />The second one also rose up, but it disappeared even more quickly than the first. <verse number="28" style="v" />I saw that the two remaining small wings were also plotting to seize control for themselves. <verse number="29" style="v" />While they were making their plans, one of the sleeping heads suddenly awoke. It was the one in the middle, the one that was larger than the other two. <verse number="30" style="v" />Then I saw that it was joined by the other heads, <verse number="31" style="v" />and when it turned to eat up the two little wings that were planning to seize power, the other two heads helped it. <verse number="32" style="v" />This head gained power over the whole world, established an oppressive rule over people everywhere, and exercised more power over the world than any of the other wings had done before. <verse number="33" style="v" />Then, as I watched, the middle head disappeared just as suddenly as the wings had done. <verse number="34" style="v" />Two heads were left, and they also gained power over the earth and its people; <verse number="35" style="v" />but while I was still watching, the head on the right ate up the head on the left.</para>

You have destroyed the homes of those who were prosperous and have torn down the walls of those who did you no harm. <verse number="43" style="v" />God Most High knows how proud and arrogant you are. The Almighty One <verse number="44" style="v" />has looked back over the world he established. The end has come; the final age is over. <verse number="45" style="v" />So, Eagle, the time has come for you to vanish, along with your big, terrible wings, your small, wicked wings, your evil heads, your awful claws, and your whole worthless body. <verse number="46" style="v" />The entire world will be set free from your violence and renewed as it sets its hope on the judgment and mercy of God, who created it.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />While the lion was speaking in this way to the eagle, I looked <verse number="2" style="v" />and saw that the last head of the eagle was gone.

    <verse number="35" style="v" />Now listen to my message, you people who serve the Lord. <verse number="36" style="v" />It is the Lord's message, so receive it and believe what he says. <verse number="37" style="v" />The disasters are approaching rapidly, and they will not be delayed. <verse number="38" style="v" />A woman in the ninth month of pregnancy may suffer labor pains for several hours, but when the time comes for the baby to be born, there is no longer any delay. <verse number="39" style="v" />In the same way, the disasters that are coming on the earth will not be delayed, and the world will groan when it is caught in its labor pains.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="40" style="v" />Listen to my message, my people, and get ready for the battle. When the disasters come, you must live as people whose home is not in this world. <verse number="41-42" style="v" />Merchants must not expect to make a profit from what they sell; they must be ready to run for their lives. Their customers must expect to lose whatever they buy. Whoever builds a house should not plan to live in it. <verse number="43" style="v" />Farmers should not expect to harvest their crops or pick their grapes. <verse number="44" style="v" />Those who marry must not expect to have children, and those who don't marry must live as if they had been widowed. <verse number="45" style="v" />Anything that is done will be useless. <verse number="46" style="v" />Foreigners will harvest the crops, seize the wealth, tear down the houses, and carry off the children as slaves. Anyone who has children will be bringing them up to be slaves or to die of starvation. <verse number="47" style="v" />Anyone who makes money will do so only to see it violently taken away. The more possessions people gather, the more they spend on their cities and houses, the more attention they give to their personal appearance, <verse number="48" style="v" />the more angry the Lord will become with them because of their sin. This is what the Lord says. <verse number="49" style="v" />Just as a respectable woman despises a prostitute, <verse number="50" style="v" />so righteousness despises sinfulness, no matter how attractive it may look. Righteousness will expose every sin in the world and condemn it face-to-face when her Defender comes. <verse number="51" style="v" />So do not imitate sinfulness or what it does, <verse number="52" style="v" />for in a very short time sinfulness will be swept out of the world and righteousness will rule among us.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="53" style="v" />Sinners must not deny their sins. Those who say that they have not sinned against God and his majesty are only bringing fiery shame upon themselves. <verse number="54" style="v" />The Lord certainly knows everything that people do; he knows their plans and innermost thoughts. <verse number="55" style="v" />When the Lord said, “Let the world be created,” it was done! When he said, “Let the sky be created,” that was done too. <verse number="56" style="v" />He set the stars in place by his command, and he knows how many of them there are. <verse number="57" style="v" />He knows what is in the deepest part of the sea and the treasures that are there. He has measured the sea and everything that is in it. <verse number="58" style="v" />By his word he confined the sea to its place and put the land on top of the water. <verse number="59" style="v" />The Lord stretched out the sky and fixed it firmly over the water like a dome. <verse number="60" style="v" />He put springs of water in the desert and lakes in the high mountains, so that water could flow down in the rivers and water the land. <verse number="61" style="v" />The Lord created human beings and gave each one of them a heart. He gave them life, breath, and understanding, <verse number="62" style="v" />which is the spirit of God the Almighty, who created everything and who knows all secrets and sees into all hidden places. <verse number="63" style="v" />My people, the Lord knows everything you plan and the secret thoughts of your heart. Sinners who try to hide their sins are doomed. <verse number="64" style="v" />The Lord will carefully examine everything you have done and bring you to judgment. <verse number="65" style="v" />On that day you will be thrown into utter confusion; all your sins will be publicly exposed and the wicked things you have done will witness against you. <verse number="66" style="v" />What will you do then? How will you hide your sins from God and his angels? <verse number="67" style="v" />God is your judge, so fear him! Abandon your sins, put away the evil you have done, and never sin again. Then God will save you from all these disasters.</para>

    <verse number="68" style="v" />A vast mob of people is ready now to descend on you and devour you like flames. They will drag some of you off and force you to eat pagan sacrifices. <verse number="69" style="v" />If you give in to them, they will ridicule you, mock you, and humiliate you. <verse number="70" style="v" />In many places near the cities <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">16.70: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">In…cities; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Latin unclear.</char></note> there will be violent persecution against those who fear the Lord. <verse number="71" style="v" />The attackers will act like wild people; they will plunder and destroy without pity all those who still fear the Lord. <verse number="72" style="v" />They will turn them out of their homes and take away all their possessions. <verse number="73" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">16.73: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Zec 13.9; 1 P 1.7.</char></note> This will be the time of testing for my chosen people, and they will prove to be as pure as refined gold.</para>

    <verse number="74" style="v" />But listen to what the Lord says: “My chosen people, the time of terrible suffering is near, but I will rescue you. <verse number="75" style="v" />Don't be afraid or have any doubts; I am your God and I will lead you. <verse number="76" style="v" />If you keep my laws and commands,” says the Lord, “you must not let your sins weigh you down or control you. <verse number="77" style="v" />Those who are chained by their sins, overwhelmed by the evil they have done, are doomed. They will be like a field overgrown with brush, with the path across it so choked with thorns that no one can get through. <verse number="78" style="v" />It is abandoned and doomed to be destroyed by fire.”</para>
