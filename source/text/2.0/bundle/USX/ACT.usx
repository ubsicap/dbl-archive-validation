    <char style="bk">The Acts of the Apostles</char> is a continuation of <char style="bk">The Gospel according to Luke</char> Its chief purpose is to tell how Jesus' early followers, led by the Holy Spirit, spread the Good News about him “in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (1.8). It is the story of the Christian movement as it began among the Jewish people and went on to become a faith for the whole world. The writer was also concerned to reassure his readers that the Christians were not a subversive political threat to the Roman Empire, and that the Christian faith was the fulfillment of the Jewish religion.</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">Acts</char> may be divided into three principal parts, reflecting the ever widening area in which the Good News about Jesus was proclaimed and the church established: (1) the beginning of the Christian movement in Jerusalem following the ascension of Jesus; (2) expansion into other parts of Palestine; and (3) further expansion, into the Mediterranean world as far as Rome.</para>
  <para style="ip">An important feature of <char style="bk">Acts</char> is the activity of the Holy Spirit, who comes with power upon the believers in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and continues to guide and strengthen the church and its leaders throughout the events reported in the book. The early Christian message is summarized in a number of sermons, and the events recorded in <char style="bk">Acts</char> show the power of this message in the lives of the believers and in the fellowship of the church.</para>

So I have brought him here before you—and especially before you, King Agrippa!—so that, after investigating his case, I may have something to write. <verse number="27" style="v" />For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to Julius, an officer in the Roman army regiment called “The Emperor's Regiment.” <verse number="2" style="v" />We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium, which was ready to leave for the seaports of the province of Asia, and we sailed away. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. <verse number="3" style="v" />The next day we arrived at Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul and allowed him to go and see his friends, to be given what he needed. <verse number="4" style="v" />We went on from there, and because the winds were blowing against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of the island of Cyprus. <verse number="5" style="v" />We crossed over the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Myra in Lycia. <verse number="6" style="v" />There the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail for Italy, so he put us aboard.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />We sailed slowly for several days and with great difficulty finally arrived off the town of Cnidus. The wind would not let us go any farther in that direction, so we sailed down the sheltered side of the island of Crete, passing by Cape Salmone. <verse number="8" style="v" />We kept close to the coast and with great difficulty came to a place called Safe Harbors, not far from the town of Lasea.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />A soft wind from the south began to blow, and the men thought that they could carry out their plan, so they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete. <verse number="14" style="v" />But soon a very strong wind—the one called “Northeaster”—blew down from the island. <verse number="15" style="v" />It hit the ship, and since it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind, we gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind. <verse number="16" style="v" />We got some shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda. There, with some difficulty we managed to make the ship's boat secure. <verse number="17" style="v" />They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship. They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks off the coast of Libya, so they lowered the sail and let the ship be carried by the wind. <verse number="18" style="v" />The violent storm continued, so on the next day they began to throw some of the ship's cargo overboard, <verse number="19" style="v" />and on the following day they threw part of the ship's equipment overboard. <verse number="20" style="v" />For many days we could not see the sun or the stars, and the wind kept on blowing very hard.

    <verse number="21" style="v" />After everyone had gone a long time without food, Paul stood before them and said, “You should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete; then we would have avoided all this damage and loss. <verse number="22" style="v" />But now I beg you, take courage! Not one of you will lose your life; only the ship will be lost. <verse number="23" style="v" />For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship came to me <verse number="24" style="v" />and said, ‘Don't be afraid, Paul!

Not even a hair of your heads will be lost.” <verse number="35" style="v" />After saying this, Paul took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, broke it, and began to eat. <verse number="36" style="v" />They took courage, and every one of them also ate some food. <verse number="37" style="v" />There was a total of 276 <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">27.37: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">276; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">some manuscripts have </char><char style="fq" closed="false">275; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">others have </char><char style="fq" closed="false">about 76.</char></note> of us on board. <verse number="38" style="v" />After everyone had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing all the wheat into the sea.</para>

    <verse number="39" style="v" />When day came, the sailors did not recognize the coast, but they noticed a bay with a beach and decided that, if possible, they would run the ship aground there. <verse number="40" style="v" />So they cut off the anchors and let them sink in the sea, and at the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars. Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship so that the wind would blow the ship forward, and we headed for shore. <verse number="41" style="v" />But the ship hit a sandbank and went aground; the front part of the ship got stuck and could not move, while the back part was being broken to pieces by the violence of the waves.</para>
