    <char style="bk">Paul's Letter to the Romans</char> was written to prepare the way for a visit Paul planned to make to the church at Rome. His plan was to work among the Christians there for a while and then, with their support, to go on to Spain. He wrote to explain his understanding of the Christian faith and its practical implications for the lives of Christians. The book contains Paul's most complete statement of his message.</para>
  <para style="ip">After greeting the people of the church at Rome and telling them of his prayers for them, Paul states the theme of the letter: “The gospel reveals how God puts people right with himself: it is through faith from beginning to end” (1.17).</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul then develops this theme. All people, both Jews and Gentiles, need to be put right with God, for all alike are under the power of sin. People are put right with God through faith in Jesus Christ. Next Paul describes the new life in union with Christ that results from this new relation with God. The believer has peace with God and is set free by God's Spirit from the power of sin and death. In chapters 5—8 Paul also discusses the purpose of the Law of God and the power of God's Spirit in the believer's life. Then the apostle wrestles with the question of how Jews and Gentiles fit into the plan of God for all people. He concludes that the Jewish rejection of Jesus is part of God's plan for bringing all people within the reach of God's grace in Jesus Christ, and he believes that the Jews will not always reject Jesus. Finally Paul writes about how the Christian life should be lived, especially about the way of love in relations with others. He takes up such themes as service to God, the duty of Christians to the state and to one another, and questions of conscience. He ends the letter with personal messages and with words of praise to God.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus and an apostle chosen and called by God to preach his Good News.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The Good News was promised long ago by God through his prophets, as written in the Holy Scriptures. <verse number="3" style="v" />It is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: as to his humanity, he was born a descendant of David; <verse number="4" style="v" />as to his divine holiness, he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being raised from death. <verse number="5" style="v" />Through him God gave me the privilege of being an apostle for the sake of Christ, in order to lead people of all nations to believe and obey. <verse number="6" style="v" />This also includes you who are in Rome, whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />And so I write to all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his own people:</para>
  <para style="p">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.</para>
  <para style="s">Prayer of Thanksgiving</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the whole world is hearing about your faith. <verse number="9" style="v" />God is my witness that what I say is true—the God whom I serve with all my heart by preaching the Good News about his Son. God knows that I remember you <verse number="10" style="v" />every time I pray. I ask that God in his good will may at last make it possible for me to visit you now. <verse number="11" style="v" />For I want very much to see you, in order to share a spiritual blessing with you to make you strong. <verse number="12" style="v" />What I mean is that both you and I will be helped at the same time, you by my faith and I by yours.</para>

    </note> You must remember, my friends, that many times I have planned to visit you, but something has always kept me from doing so. I want to win converts among you also, as I have among other Gentiles. <verse number="14" style="v" />For I have an obligation to all peoples, to the civilized and to the savage, to the educated and to the ignorant. <verse number="15" style="v" />So then, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who live in Rome.</para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" />God's anger is revealed from heaven against all the sin and evil of the people whose evil ways prevent the truth from being known. <verse number="19" style="v" />God punishes them, because what can be known about God is plain to them, for God himself made it plain. <verse number="20" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">1.20: </char><char style="xdc" closed="false">Ws 13.1-9; Si 17.8.</char></note> Ever since God created the world, his invisible qualities, both his eternal power and his divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made.

    <verse number="24" style="v" />And so God has given those people over to do the filthy things their hearts desire, and they do shameful things with each other. <verse number="25" style="v" />They exchange the truth about God for a lie; they worship and serve what God has created instead of the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever! Amen.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Because they do this, God has given them over to shameful passions. Even the women pervert the natural use of their sex by unnatural acts. <verse number="27" style="v" />In the same way the men give up natural sexual relations with women and burn with passion for each other. Men do shameful things with each other, and as a result they bring upon themselves the punishment they deserve for their wrongdoing.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />Because those people refuse to keep in mind the true knowledge about God, he has given them over to corrupted minds, so that they do the things that they should not do. <verse number="29" style="v" />They are filled with all kinds of wickedness, evil, greed, and vice; they are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, deceit, and malice. They gossip <verse number="30" style="v" />and speak evil of one another; they are hateful to God, insolent, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.30: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">are hateful to God, insolent; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">hate God, and are insolent.</char></note> proud, and boastful; they think of more ways to do evil; they disobey their parents; <verse number="31" style="v" />they have no conscience; they do not keep their promises, and they show no kindness or pity for others. <verse number="32" style="v" />They know that God's law says that people who live in this way deserve death. Yet, not only do they continue to do these very things, but they even approve of others who do them.</para>

    </note> Do you, my friend, pass judgment on others? You have no excuse at all, whoever you are. For when you judge others and then do the same things which they do, you condemn yourself. <verse number="2" style="v" />We know that God is right when he judges the people who do such things as these. <verse number="3" style="v" />But you, my friend, do those very things for which you pass judgment on others!

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The Gentiles do not have the Law of Moses; they sin and are lost apart from the Law. The Jews have the Law; they sin and are judged by the Law. <verse number="13" style="v" />For it is not by hearing the Law that people are put right with God, but by doing what the Law commands. <verse number="14" style="v" />The Gentiles do not have the Law; but whenever they do by instinct what the Law commands, they are their own law, even though they do not have the Law. <verse number="15" style="v" />Their conduct shows that what the Law commands is written in their hearts. Their consciences also show that this is true, since their thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes defend them. <verse number="16" style="v" />And so, according to the Good News I preach, this is how it will be on that Day when God through Jesus Christ will judge the secret thoughts of all.</para>
  <para style="s">The Jews and the Law</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />What about you? You call yourself a Jew; you depend on the Law and boast about God; <verse number="18" style="v" />you know what God wants you to do, and you have learned from the Law to choose what is right; <verse number="19" style="v" />you are sure that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in darkness, <verse number="20" style="v" />an instructor for the foolish, and a teacher for the ignorant. You are certain that in the Law you have the full content of knowledge and of truth. <verse number="21" style="v" />You teach others—why don't you teach yourself? You preach, “Do not steal”—but do you yourself steal? <verse number="22" style="v" />You say, “Do not commit adultery”—but do you commit adultery?

    <verse number="25" style="v" />If you obey the Law, your circumcision is of value; but if you disobey the Law, you might as well never have been circumcised. <verse number="26" style="v" />If the Gentile, who is not circumcised, obeys the commands of the Law, will not God regard him as though he were circumcised? <verse number="27" style="v" />And so you Jews will be condemned by the Gentiles because you break the Law, even though you have it written down and are circumcised; but they obey the Law, even though they are not physically circumcised. <verse number="28" style="v" />After all, who is a real Jew, truly circumcised? It is not the man who is a Jew on the outside, whose circumcision is a physical thing. <verse number="29" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.29: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Dt 30.6.</char></note> Rather, the real Jew is the person who is a Jew on the inside, that is, whose heart has been circumcised, and this is the work of God's Spirit, not of the written Law. Such a person receives praise from God, not from human beings.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Do the Jews then have any advantage over the Gentiles? Or is there any value in being circumcised? <verse number="2" style="v" />Much, indeed, in every way! In the first place, God trusted his message to the Jews. <verse number="3" style="v" />But what if some of them were not faithful? Does this mean that God will not be faithful? <verse number="4" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">3.4: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Ps 51.4 (LXX).</char></note> Certainly not!

  <para style="q2">you must win your case when you are being tried.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />But what if our doing wrong serves to show up more clearly God's doing right? Can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us?

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />But what if my untruth serves God's glory by making his truth stand out more clearly? Why should I still be condemned as a sinner? <verse number="8" style="v" />Why not say, then, “Let us do evil so that good may come”? Some people, indeed, have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing! They will be condemned, as they should be.</para>

God did this in order to demonstrate that he is righteous.

But God's grace is much greater, and so is his free gift to so many people through the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ. <verse number="16" style="v" />And there is a difference between God's gift and the sin of one man. After the one sin, came the judgment of “Guilty”; but after so many sins, comes the undeserved gift of “Not guilty!” <verse number="17" style="v" />It is true that through the sin of one man death began to rule because of that one man.

As far as the Law is concerned, you also have died because you are part of the body of Christ; and now you belong to him who was raised from death in order that we might be useful in the service of God. <verse number="5" style="v" />For when we lived according to our human nature, the sinful desires stirred up by the Law were at work in our bodies, and all we did ended in death. <verse number="6" style="v" />Now, however, we are free from the Law, because we died to that which once held us prisoners.

If the Law had not said, “Do not desire what belongs to someone else,” I would not have known such a desire. <verse number="8" style="v" />But by means of that commandment sin found its chance to stir up all kinds of selfish desires in me. Apart from law, sin is a dead thing. <verse number="9" style="v" />I myself was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life, <verse number="10" style="v" />and I died.
