    <char style="bk">The book of Judges</char> is composed of stories from the lawless period of Israel's history between the invasion of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy. These stories are about the exploits of national heroes called “judges,” most of whom were military leaders rather than judges in the legal sense of the word. One of the better known of them is Samson, whose deeds are recorded in chapters 13—16.</para>
  <para style="ip">The great lesson of the book is that Israel's survival depended on loyalty to God, while disloyalty always led to disaster. But there was more than this: even when the nation was disloyal to God and disaster came, God was always ready to save his people when they repented and turned to him again.</para>

  <para style="s">The Tribes of Judah and Simeon Capture Adonibezek</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />After Joshua's death the people of Israel asked the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, “Which of our tribes should be the first to go and attack the Canaanites?”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> answered, “The tribe of Judah will go first. I am giving them control of the land.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />The people of Judah said to the people of Simeon, “Go with us into the territory assigned to us, and we will fight the Canaanites together. Then we will go with you into the territory assigned to you.” So the tribes of Simeon <verse number="4" style="v" />and Judah went into battle together. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave them victory over the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek. <verse number="5" style="v" />They found Adonibezek there and fought him. <verse number="6" style="v" />He ran away, but they chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. <verse number="7" style="v" />Adonibezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. God has now done to me what I did to them.” He was taken to Jerusalem, where he died.</para>
  <para style="s">The Tribe of Judah Conquers Jerusalem and Hebron</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />The people of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed its people and set fire to the city. <verse number="9" style="v" />After this they went on to fight the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the foothills, and in the dry country to the south. <verse number="10" style="v" />They marched against the Canaanites living in the city of Hebron, which used to be called Kiriath Arba. There they defeated the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</para>

  <para style="r">(Joshua 15.13-19)</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />From there the men of Judah marched against the city of Debir, at that time called Kiriath Sepher. <verse number="12" style="v" />One of them, called Caleb, said, “I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher.” <verse number="13" style="v" />Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. <verse number="14" style="v" />On the wedding day Othniel urged her <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1.14: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Some ancient translations </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Othniel urged her; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">she urged Othniel.</char></note> to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked her what she wanted. <verse number="15" style="v" />She answered, “I want some water holes. The land you have given me is in the dry country.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.</para>

    <verse number="16" style="v" />The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went on with the people of Judah from Jericho, the city of palm trees, into the barren country south of Arad in Judah.

    <verse number="22-23" style="v" />The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh went to attack the city of Bethel, at that time called Luz. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> helped them.

  <para style="s">The Death of Joshua</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />Joshua sent the people of Israel on their way, and each man went to take possession of his own share of the land. <verse number="7" style="v" />As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, and even after his death they continued to do so as long as the leaders were alive who had seen for themselves all the great things that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had done for Israel. <verse number="8" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s servant Joshua son of Nun died at the age of a hundred and ten. <verse number="9" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.9: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Js 19.49,50.</char></note> He was buried in his own part of the land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. <verse number="10" style="v" />That whole generation also died, and the next generation forgot the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and what he had done for Israel.</para>
  <para style="s">Israel Stops Worshiping the <char style="nd">Lord</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then the people of Israel sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and began to serve the Baals. <verse number="12" style="v" />They stopped worshiping the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of their ancestors, the God who had brought them out of Egypt, and they began to worship other gods, the gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and made the <char style="nd">Lord</char> angry. <verse number="13" style="v" />They stopped worshiping the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and served the Baals and the Astartes. <verse number="14" style="v" />And so the <char style="nd">Lord</char> became furious with Israel and let raiders attack and rob them. He let the enemies all around overpower them, and the Israelites could no longer protect themselves. <verse number="15" style="v" />Every time they would go into battle, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> was against them, just as he had said he would be. They were in great distress.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave the Israelites leaders who saved them from the raiders. <verse number="17" style="v" />But the Israelites paid no attention to their leaders. Israel was unfaithful to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and worshiped other gods. Their fathers had obeyed the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s commands, but this new generation soon stopped doing so. <verse number="18" style="v" />Whenever the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave Israel a leader, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> would help that leader and would save the people from their enemies as long as that leader lived. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> would have mercy on them because they groaned under their suffering and oppression. <verse number="19" style="v" />But when the leader died, the people would return to the old ways and behave worse than the previous generation. They would serve and worship other gods, and stubbornly continue their own evil ways. <verse number="20" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> would become furious with Israel and say, “This nation has broken the covenant that I commanded their ancestors to keep. Because they have not obeyed me, <verse number="21" style="v" />I will no longer drive out any of the nations that were still in the land when Joshua died. <verse number="22" style="v" />I will use them to find out whether or not these Israelites will follow my ways, as their ancestors did.” <verse number="23" style="v" />So the <char style="nd">Lord</char> allowed these nations to remain in the land; he did not give Joshua victory over them, nor did he drive them out soon after Joshua's death.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="s">The Nations Remaining in the Land</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />So then, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> left some nations in the land to test the Israelites who had not been through the wars in Canaan. <verse number="2" style="v" />He did this only in order to teach each generation of Israelites about war, especially those who had never been in battle before. <verse number="3" style="v" />Those left in the land were the five Philistine cities, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Hamath Pass. <verse number="4" style="v" />They were to be a test for Israel, to find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commands that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had given their ancestors through Moses. <verse number="5" style="v" />And so the people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <verse number="6" style="v" />They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods.</para>
  <para style="s">Othniel</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />The people of Israel forgot the <char style="nd">Lord</char> their God; they sinned against him and worshiped the idols of Baal and Asherah. <verse number="8" style="v" />So the <char style="nd">Lord</char> became angry with Israel and let King Cushan Rishathaim of Mesopotamia conquer them. They were subject to him for eight years. <verse number="9" style="v" />Then the Israelites cried out to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, and he sent someone to free them. This was Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz. <verse number="10" style="v" />The spirit of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> came upon him, and he became Israel's leader. Othniel went to war, and the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave him the victory over the king of Mesopotamia. <verse number="11" style="v" />There was peace in the land for forty years, and then Othniel died.</para>
  <para style="s">Ehud</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />The people of Israel sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char> again. Because of this the <char style="nd">Lord</char> made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel. <verse number="13" style="v" />Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites; they defeated Israel and captured Jericho, the city of palm trees. <verse number="14" style="v" />The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Then the Israelites cried out to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, and he sent someone to free them. This was Ehud, a left-handed man, who was the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. The people of Israel sent Ehud to King Eglon of Moab with gifts for him. <verse number="16" style="v" />Ehud had made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long. He had it fastened on his right side under his clothes. <verse number="17" style="v" />Then he took the gifts to Eglon, who was a very fat man. <verse number="18" style="v" />When Ehud had given him the gifts, he told the men who had carried them to go back home. <verse number="19" style="v" />But Ehud himself turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal, went back to Eglon, and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”</para>
  <para style="p">So the king ordered his servants, “Leave us alone!” And they all went out.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />Then, as the king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof, Ehud went over to him and said, “I have a message from God for you.” The king stood up. <verse number="21" style="v" />With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the king's belly. <verse number="22" style="v" />The whole sword went in, handle and all, and the fat covered it up. Ehud did not pull it out of the king's belly, and it stuck out behind, between his legs. <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.22: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Probable text </char><char style="fq" closed="false">it stuck…legs; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew unclear.</char></note> <verse number="23" style="v" />Then Ehud went outside, closed the doors behind him, locked them, <verse number="24" style="v" />and left. The servants came and saw that the doors were locked, but they only thought that the king was inside, relieving himself. <verse number="25" style="v" />They waited as long as they thought they should, but when he still did not open the door, they took the key and opened it. And there was their master, lying dead on the floor.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />Ehud got away while they were waiting. He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah. <verse number="27" style="v" />When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim, he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle; then he led them down from the hills. <verse number="28" style="v" />He told them, “Follow me! The <char style="nd">Lord</char> has given you victory over your enemies, the Moabites.” So they followed Ehud down and captured the place where the Moabites were to cross the Jordan; they did not allow anyone to cross. <verse number="29" style="v" />That day they killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers; none of them escaped. <verse number="30" style="v" />That day the Israelites defeated Moab, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.</para>
  <para style="s">Shamgar</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath. He too rescued Israel, and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.</para>

  <para style="s">Deborah and Barak</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />After Ehud died, the people of Israel sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char> again. <verse number="2" style="v" />So the <char style="nd">Lord</char> let them be conquered by Jabin, a Canaanite king who ruled in the city of Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived at Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles. <verse number="3" style="v" />Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots, and he ruled the people of Israel with cruelty and violence for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> for help.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Now Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet, and she was serving as a judge for the Israelites at that time. <verse number="5" style="v" />She would sit under a certain palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel would go there for her decisions. <verse number="6" style="v" />One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam from the city of Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, has given you this command: ‘Take ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them to Mount Tabor. <verse number="7" style="v" />I will bring Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, to fight you at the Kishon River. He will have his chariots and soldiers, but I will give you victory over him.’”</para>

Deborah went with him.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Once again the people of Israel sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, so he let the people of Midian rule them for seven years. <verse number="2" style="v" />The Midianites were stronger than Israel, and the people of Israel hid from them in caves and other safe places in the hills. <verse number="3" style="v" />Whenever the Israelites would plant their crops, the Midianites would come with the Amalekites and the desert tribes and attack them. <verse number="4" style="v" />They would camp on the land and destroy the crops as far south as the area around Gaza. They would take all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, and leave nothing for the Israelites to live on. <verse number="5" style="v" />They would come with their livestock and tents, as thick as locusts. They and their camels were too many to count. They came and devastated the land, <verse number="6" style="v" />and Israel was helpless against them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Then the people of Israel cried out to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> for help against the Midianites, <verse number="8" style="v" />and he sent them a prophet who brought them this message from the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel: “I brought you out of slavery in Egypt. <verse number="9" style="v" />I rescued you from the Egyptians and from the people who fought you here in this land. I drove them out as you advanced, and I gave you their land. <verse number="10" style="v" />I told you that I am the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God and that you should not worship the gods of the Amorites, whose land you are now living in. But you have not listened to me.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s angel came to the village of Ophrah and sat under the oak tree that belonged to Joash, a man of the clan of Abiezer. His son Gideon was threshing some wheat secretly in a wine press, so that the Midianites would not see him. <verse number="12" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s angel appeared to him there and said, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> is with you, brave and mighty man!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Gideon said to him, “If I may ask, sir, why has all this happened to us if the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is with us? What happened to all the wonderful things that our fathers told us the <char style="nd">Lord</char> used to do—how he brought them out of Egypt? The <char style="nd">Lord</char> has abandoned us and left us to the mercy of the Midianites.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> ordered him, “Go with all your great strength and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I myself am sending you.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Gideon replied, “But Lord, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least important member of my family.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> answered, “You can do it because I will help you. You will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Gideon replied, “If you are pleased with me, give me some proof that you are really the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="18" style="v" />Please do not leave until I bring you an offering of food.”</para>
  <para style="p">He said, “I will stay until you come back.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />So Gideon went into his house and cooked a young goat and used a bushel of flour to make bread without any yeast. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, brought them to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s angel under the oak tree, and gave them to him. <verse number="20" style="v" />The angel told him, “Put the meat and the bread on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” Gideon did so. <verse number="21" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s angel reached out and touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick he was holding. Fire came out of the rock and burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel disappeared.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Gideon then realized that it was the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s angel he had seen, and he said in terror, “Sovereign <char style="nd">Lord</char>! I have seen your angel face-to-face!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />But the <char style="nd">Lord</char> told him, “Peace. Don't be afraid. You will not die.” <verse number="24" style="v" />Gideon built an altar to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> there and named it “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> is Peace.” (It is still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the clan of Abiezer.)</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />That night the <char style="nd">Lord</char> told Gideon, “Take your father's bull and another bull seven years old, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">6.25: </char><char style="fq" closed="false">bull and another bull seven years old; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">or </char><char style="fq" closed="false">bull, the seven-year-old one.</char></note> tear down your father's altar to Baal, and cut down the symbol of the goddess Asherah, which is beside it. <verse number="26" style="v" />Build a well-constructed altar to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God on top of this mound.

He was too afraid of his family and the people in town to do it by day, so he did it at night.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />When the people in town got up early the next morning, they found that the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah had been cut down, and that the second bull had been burned on the altar that had been built there. <verse number="29" style="v" />They asked each other, “Who did this?” They investigated and found out that Gideon son of Joash had done it. <verse number="30" style="v" />Then they said to Joash, “Bring your son out here, so that we can kill him! He tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the symbol of Asherah beside it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />But Joash said to all those who confronted him, “Are you arguing for Baal? Are you defending him? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning. If Baal is a god, let him defend himself. It is his altar that was torn down.” <verse number="32" style="v" />From then on Gideon was known as Jerubbaal, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">6.32: </char><char style="fk" closed="false">Jerubbaal: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">This name in Hebrew means “Let Baal defend himself.”</char></note> because Joash said, “Let Baal defend himself; it is his altar that was torn down.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="33" style="v" />Then all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribes assembled, crossed the Jordan River, and camped in Jezreel Valley. <verse number="34" style="v" />The spirit of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> took control of Gideon, and he blew a trumpet to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him. <verse number="35" style="v" />He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh to call them to follow him. He sent messengers to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they also came to join him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="36" style="v" />Then Gideon said to God, “You say that you have decided to use me to rescue Israel. <verse number="37" style="v" />Well, I am putting some wool on the ground where we thresh the wheat. If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground, then I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel.” <verse number="38" style="v" />That is exactly what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water. <verse number="39" style="v" />Then Gideon said to God, “Don't be angry with me; let me speak just once more. Please let me make one more test with the wool. This time let the wool be dry, and the ground be wet.” <verse number="40" style="v" />That night God did that very thing. The next morning the wool was dry, but the ground was wet with dew.</para>
  <chapter number="7" style="c" />
  <para style="s">Gideon Defeats the Midianites</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />One day Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring. The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Gideon, “The men you have are too many for me to give them victory over the Midianites. They might think that they had won by themselves, and so give me no credit. <verse number="3" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">7.3: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Dt 20.8.</char></note> Announce to the people, ‘Anyone who is afraid should go back home, and we will stay here at Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand went back, but ten thousand stayed.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Gideon, “You still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will separate them for you there. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go.” <verse number="5" style="v" />Gideon took the men down to the water, and the <char style="nd">Lord</char> told him, “Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue like a dog, from everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.” <verse number="6" style="v" />There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it; all the others got down on their knees to drink. <verse number="7" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Gideon, “I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites with the three hundred men who lapped the water. Tell everyone else to go home.” <verse number="8" style="v" />So Gideon sent all the Israelites home, except the three hundred, who kept all the supplies and trumpets. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />That night the <char style="nd">Lord</char> commanded Gideon, “Get up and attack the camp; I am giving you victory over it. <verse number="10" style="v" />But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah. <verse number="11" style="v" />You will hear what they are saying, and then you will have the courage to attack.” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp. <verse number="12" style="v" />The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and they had as many camels as there are grains of sand on the seashore.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, “I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent. The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />His friend replied, “It's the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can't mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />When Gideon heard about the man's dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and said, “Get up! The <char style="nd">Lord</char> is giving you victory over the Midianite army!” <verse number="16" style="v" />He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside it. <verse number="17" style="v" />He told them, “When I get to the edge of the camp, watch me, and do what I do. <verse number="18" style="v" />When my group and I blow our trumpets, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, ‘For the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and for Gideon!’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Gideon and his one hundred men came to the edge of the camp a while before midnight, just after the guard had been changed. Then they blew the trumpets and broke the jars they were holding, <verse number="20" style="v" />and the other two groups did the same. They all held the torches in their left hands, the trumpets in their right, and shouted, “A sword for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and for Gideon!” <verse number="21" style="v" />Every man stood in his place around the camp, and the whole enemy army ran away yelling. <verse number="22" style="v" />While Gideon's men were blowing their trumpets, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> made the enemy troops attack each other with their swords. They ran toward Zarethan as far as Beth Shittah, as far as the town of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />Then men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. <verse number="24" style="v" />Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say, “Come down and fight the Midianites. Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah, to keep the Midianites from crossing them.” The men of Ephraim were called together, and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah. <verse number="25" style="v" />They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock, and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan.</para>

  <para style="s">The Final Defeat of the Midianites</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Then the people of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why didn't you call us when you went to fight the Midianites? Why did you treat us like this?” They complained bitterly about it.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />But he told them, “What I was able to do is nothing compared with what you have done.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />By this time Gideon and his three hundred men had come to the Jordan River and had crossed it. They were exhausted, but were still pursuing the enemy. <verse number="5" style="v" />When they arrived at Sukkoth, he said to the men of the town, “Please give my men some loaves of bread.

    <verse number="13" style="v" />When Gideon was returning from the battle by way of Heres Pass, <verse number="14" style="v" />he captured a young man from Sukkoth and questioned him. The young man wrote down for Gideon the names of the seventy-seven leading men of Sukkoth. <verse number="15" style="v" />Then Gideon went to the men of Sukkoth and said, “Remember when you refused to help me? You said that you couldn't give any food to my exhausted army because I hadn't captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet. Well, here they are!” <verse number="16" style="v" />He then took thorns and briers from the desert and used them to punish the leaders of Sukkoth. <verse number="17" style="v" />He also tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men of that city.</para>

Remember that Abimelech is your own flesh and blood.” <verse number="3" style="v" />His mother's relatives talked to the men of Shechem about this for him, and the men of Shechem decided to follow Abimelech because he was their relative. <verse number="4" style="v" />They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant, and with this money he hired a bunch of worthless scoundrels to join him. <verse number="5" style="v" />He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and there on top of a single stone he killed his seventy brothers, Gideon's sons.

    <verse number="16" style="v" />“Now then,” Jotham continued, “were you really honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king?

He risked his life to save you from the Midianites. <verse number="18" style="v" />But today you turned against my father's family. You killed his sons—seventy men on a single stone—and just because Abimelech, his son by his servant woman, is your relative, you have made him king of Shechem. <verse number="19" style="v" />Now then, if what you did today to Gideon and his family was sincere and honest, then be happy with Abimelech and let him be happy with you. <verse number="20" style="v" />But if not, may fire blaze out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and Bethmillo. May fire blaze out from the men of Shechem and Bethmillo and burn Abimelech up.” <verse number="21" style="v" />Then because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech, Jotham ran away and went to live at Beer.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Abimelech ruled Israel for three years. <verse number="23" style="v" />Then God made Abimelech and the men of Shechem hostile to each other, and they rebelled against Abimelech. <verse number="24" style="v" />This happened so that Abimelech and the men of Shechem, who encouraged him to murder Gideon's seventy sons, would pay for their crime. <verse number="25" style="v" />The men of Shechem put men in ambush against Abimelech on the mountaintops, and they robbed everyone who passed their way. Abimelech was told about this.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="30" style="v" />Zebul, the ruler of the city, became angry when he heard what Gaal had said. <verse number="31" style="v" />He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">9.31: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Probable text </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Arumah; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew unclear.</char></note> to say, “Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are not going to let you into the city. <verse number="32" style="v" />Now then, you and your men should move by night and hide in the fields. <verse number="33" style="v" />Get up tomorrow morning at sunrise and make a sudden attack on the city.

    <verse number="38" style="v" />Then Zebul said to him, “Where is all your big talk now? You were the one who asked why we should serve this man Abimelech. These are the men you were making fun of. Go on out now and fight them.” <verse number="39" style="v" />Gaal led the men of Shechem out and fought Abimelech. <verse number="40" style="v" />Abimelech started after Gaal, and Gaal ran. Many were wounded, even at the city gate. <verse number="41" style="v" />Abimelech lived in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem, so that they could no longer live there.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="42" style="v" />The next day Abimelech found out that the people of Shechem were planning to go out into the fields, <verse number="43" style="v" />so he took his men, divided them into three groups, and hid in the fields, waiting. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he came out of hiding to kill them. <verse number="44" style="v" />While Abimelech and his group hurried forward to guard the city gate, the other two companies attacked the people in the fields and killed them all. <verse number="45" style="v" />The fighting continued all day long. Abimelech captured the city, killed its people, tore it down, and covered the ground with salt.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="46" style="v" />When all the leading men in the fort at Shechem heard about this, they sought safety in the stronghold of the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant. <verse number="47" style="v" />Abimelech was told that they had gathered there, <verse number="48" style="v" />so he went up to Mount Zalmon with his men. There he took an ax, cut a limb off a tree, and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. <verse number="49" style="v" />So everyone cut off a tree limb; then they followed Abimelech and piled the wood up against the stronghold. They set it on fire, with the people inside, and all the people of the fort died—about a thousand men and women.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="50" style="v" />Then Abimelech went to Thebez, surrounded that city, and captured it. <verse number="51" style="v" />There was a strong tower there, and every man and woman in the city, including the leaders, ran to it. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof. <verse number="52" style="v" />When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he went up to the door to set the tower on fire. <verse number="53" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">9.53: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">2 S 11.21.</char></note> But a woman threw a millstone down on his head and fractured his skull. <verse number="54" style="v" />Then he quickly called the young man who was carrying his weapons and told him, “Draw your sword and kill me.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="56" style="v" />And so it was that God paid Abimelech back for the crime that he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. <verse number="57" style="v" />God also made the men of Shechem suffer for their wickedness, just as Jotham, Gideon's son, said they would when he cursed them.</para>

We have made a solemn promise to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> that we will not give them any of our daughters.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />When they asked if there was some group out of the tribes of Israel that had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah, they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there; <verse number="9" style="v" />at the roll call of the army no one from Jabesh had responded. <verse number="10" style="v" />So the assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders, “Go and kill everyone in Jabesh, including women and children. <verse number="11" style="v" />Kill all the males, and also every woman who is not a virgin.” <verse number="12" style="v" />They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh, so they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" />Then the whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war. <verse number="14" style="v" />The Benjaminites came back, and the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed. But there were not enough of them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had broken the unity of the tribes of Israel. <verse number="16" style="v" />So the leaders of the gathering said, “There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin. What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left? <verse number="17" style="v" />Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive, <verse number="18" style="v" />but we cannot allow them to marry our daughters, because we have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Then they thought, “The yearly festival of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> at Shiloh is coming soon.” (Shiloh is north of Bethel, south of Lebonah, and east of the road between Bethel and Shechem.) <verse number="20" style="v" />They told the Benjaminites, “Go and hide in the vineyards <verse number="21" style="v" />and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you. <verse number="22" style="v" />If their fathers or brothers come to you <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">21.22: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">you; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">us.</char></note> and protest, you <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">21.22: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Probable text </char><char style="fq" closed="false">you; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">we.</char></note> can tell them, ‘Please let us keep them, because we did not take them from you in battle to be our wives. And since you did not give them to us, you are not guilty of breaking your promise.’”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />The Benjaminites did this; each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away. Then they went back to their own territory, rebuilt their towns, and lived there. <verse number="24" style="v" />At the same time the rest of the Israelites left, and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property.</para>
