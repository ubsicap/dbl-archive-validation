  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />This history begins when Alexander the Great, son of Philip of Macedonia, marched from Macedonia and attacked Darius, king of Persia and Media. Alexander enlarged the Greek Empire by defeating Darius and seizing his throne. <verse number="2" style="v" />He fought many battles, captured fortified cities, and put the kings of the region to death. <verse number="3" style="v" />As he advanced to the ends of the earth, he plundered many nations; and when he had conquered the world, he became proud and arrogant. <verse number="4" style="v" />By building up a strong army, he dominated whole nations and their rulers, and forced everyone to pay him taxes.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5-7" style="v" />When Alexander had been emperor for twelve years, he fell ill and realized that he was about to die. He called together his generals, noblemen who had been brought up with him since his early childhood, and he divided his empire, giving a part to each of them. <verse number="8" style="v" />After his death, the generals took control, <verse number="9" style="v" />and each had himself crowned king of his own territory. The descendants of these kings ruled for many generations and brought a great deal of misery on the world.</para>

    <verse number="15" style="v" />Then the king's officials, who were forcing the people to turn from God, came to the town of Modein to force the people there to offer pagan sacrifices. <verse number="16" style="v" />Many of the Israelites came to meet them, including Mattathias and his sons. <verse number="17" style="v" />The king's officials said to Mattathias, “You are a respected leader in this town, and you have the support of your sons and relatives. <verse number="18" style="v" />Why not be the first one here to do what the king has commanded?

    <verse number="29-30" style="v" />At that time also many of the Israelites who were seeking to be right with God through obedience to the Law went out to live in the wilderness, taking their children, their wives, and their livestock with them, because of the terrible oppression they were suffering. <verse number="31" style="v" />The report soon reached the king's officials and the soldiers in the fort at Jerusalem that some men who had defied the king's command had gone into hiding in the wilderness. <verse number="32" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.32: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Macc 6.11.</char></note> A large force of soldiers pursued them, caught up with them, set up camp opposite them, and prepared to attack them on the Sabbath. <verse number="33" style="v" />“There is still time,” they shouted out to the Jews. “Come out and obey the king's command, and we will spare your lives.”</para>

    <verse number="34" style="v" />“We will not come out,” they answered. “We will not obey the king's command, and we will not profane the Sabbath.”</para>

    <verse number="35" style="v" />The soldiers attacked them immediately, <verse number="36" style="v" />but the Jews did nothing to resist; they did not even throw stones or block the entrances to the caves where they were hiding. <verse number="37" style="v" />They said, “We will all die with a clear conscience. Let heaven and earth bear witness that you are slaughtering us unjustly.” <verse number="38" style="v" />So the enemy attacked them on the Sabbath and killed the men, their wives, their children, and their livestock. A thousand people died.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="42" style="v" />Then Mattathias and his friends were joined by a group of devout and patriotic Jews, the strongest and bravest men in Israel, who had all volunteered to defend the Law. <verse number="43" style="v" />In addition, everyone who was fleeing from the persecution joined them and strengthened their forces. <verse number="44" style="v" />Now that they had an army, they gave vent to their anger by attacking the renegade Jews. Those who escaped were forced to flee to the Gentiles for safety. <verse number="45" style="v" />Mattathias and his friends went everywhere tearing down pagan altars <verse number="46" style="v" />and circumcising by force every uncircumcised boy they found within the borders of Israel. <verse number="47" style="v" />They were also successful in hunting down the arrogant Gentile officials. <verse number="48" style="v" />They rescued the Law of Moses from the Gentiles and their kings and broke the power of the wicked King Antiochus.</para>

He took 10,000 elite troops from Jerusalem; his brother Simon also brought troops, and their two forces <verse number="75" style="v" />set up camp outside of Joppa. The men of the city refused to let them in because there was a detachment of Apollonius' troops there, but Jonathan attacked, <verse number="76" style="v" />and the men in the city became so frightened that they opened the gates, allowing Jonathan to capture Joppa. <verse number="77" style="v" />When Apollonius heard what had happened, he took 3,000 cavalry and a large army of infantry and pretended to retreat south toward Azotus. However, relying upon the strength of his cavalry, he marched into the plain with his main force, <verse number="78-79" style="v" />positioning 1,000 cavalry where they could attack Jonathan's forces from the rear. Jonathan continued his pursuit as far as Azotus, where the two armies met in battle. <verse number="80" style="v" />Not until then did Jonathan realize that he was caught in an ambush. His army was surrounded, and enemy arrows rained down on them from morning until evening. <verse number="81" style="v" />But Jonathan's men stood firm, as he had ordered, and the attacking cavalry grew tired. <verse number="82" style="v" />Then, when the cavalry was exhausted, Simon appeared on the scene with his forces and attacked and overwhelmed the enemy infantry, who broke ranks and fled. <verse number="83" style="v" />The cavalry, which by now was scattered all over the battlefield, fled to Azotus, where they took refuge in the temple of Dagon, their god. <verse number="84" style="v" />But Jonathan set fire to the city and to the temple of Dagon, burning to death all those who had taken refuge there. Then he set fire to the surrounding towns and looted them. <verse number="85" style="v" />That day about 8,000 were either killed in the battle or burned to death. <verse number="86" style="v" />Jonathan left and set up camp at Ascalon, where the people of the city came out to welcome him with great honors. <verse number="87" style="v" />Jonathan and his men returned to Jerusalem with large quantities of loot.</para>

He intended to trap Alexander, take his kingdom, and add it to his own, <verse number="2" style="v" />so he went to Syria with promises of peace, and the citizens opened their gates to him and welcomed him. King Alexander had ordered them to do this because Ptolemy was his father-in-law. <verse number="3" style="v" />But as Ptolemy moved north, he stationed a detachment of troops in each town. <verse number="4" style="v" />When he reached Azotus, the people there showed him the burned ruins of the temple of Dagon and all the destruction in the city and the surrounding towns. There were corpses everywhere. The bodies of the men Jonathan had burned to death during the battle were now stacked up along Ptolemy's route. <verse number="5" style="v" />The people told him what Jonathan had done, hoping that he would hold him responsible, but Ptolemy said nothing. <verse number="6" style="v" />Jonathan, with all the proper ceremony, went to Joppa to meet him. They exchanged greetings and spent the night there. <verse number="7" style="v" />Jonathan accompanied him as far as the Eleutherus River before returning to Jerusalem. <verse number="8" style="v" />In this way King Ptolemy, in his plot against Alexander, took control of the towns along the coast as far north as Seleucia-by-the-sea.</para>
