    <char style="bk">Second Kings</char> continues the history of the two Israelite kingdoms where <char style="bk">First Kings</char> leaves off. The book may be divided into two parts: (1) The story of the two kingdoms from the middle of the ninth century <char style="sc">b.c.</char> down to the fall of Samaria and the end of the northern kingdom in 722 <char style="sc">b.c.</char> (2) The story of the kingdom of Judah from the fall of the kingdom of Israel down to the capture and destruction of Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia in 586 <char style="sc">b.c.</char> The book ends with an account of Gedaliah as governor of Judah under the Babylonians and a report of the release of King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison in Babylon.</para>
  <para style="ip">These national disasters took place because of the unfaithfulness of the kings and people of Israel and Judah. The destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of many of the people of Judah was one of the great turning points of Israelite history.</para>
  <para style="ip">The prophet who stands out in <char style="bk">Second Kings</char> is Elijah's successor Elisha.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />After the death of King Ahab of Israel the country of Moab rebelled against Israel.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />King Ahaziah of Israel fell off the balcony on the roof of his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent some messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, in order to find out whether or not he would recover. <verse number="3" style="v" />But an angel of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> commanded Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe, to go and meet the messengers of King Ahaziah and ask them, “Why are you going to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? <verse number="4" style="v" />Tell the king that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> says, ‘You will not recover from your injuries; you will die!’”</para>
  <para style="p">Elijah did as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> commanded, <verse number="5" style="v" />and the messengers returned to the king. “Why have you come back?” he asked.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />They answered, “We were met by a man who told us to come back and tell you that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> says to you, ‘Why are you sending messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? You will not recover from your injuries; you will die!’”</para>

  <para style="p">“It's Elijah!” the king exclaimed.</para>
  <para style="p">

    <verse number="13" style="v" />Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />The angel of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Elijah, “Go down with him, and don't be afraid.” So Elijah went with the officer to the king <verse number="16" style="v" />and said to him, “This is what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> says: ‘Because you sent messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron—as if there were no god in Israel to consult—you will not get well; you will die!’”</para>

  <para style="s">Elijah Is Taken Up to Heaven</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The time came for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal, <verse number="2" style="v" />and on the way Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has ordered me to go to Bethel.”</para>
  <para style="p">But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living <char style="nd">Lord</char> and to you that I will not leave you.” So they went on to Bethel.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is going to take your master away from you today?”</para>
  <para style="p">“Yes, I know,” Elisha answered. “But let's not talk about it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has ordered me to go to Jericho.”</para>
  <para style="p">But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living <char style="nd">Lord</char> and to you that I will not leave you.” So they went on to Jericho.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is going to take your master away from you today?”</para>
  <para style="p">“Yes, I know,” Elisha answered. “But let's not talk about it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Now stay here; the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has ordered me to go to the Jordan River.”</para>
  <para style="p">But Elisha answered, “I swear by my loyalty to the living <char style="nd">Lord</char> and to you that I will not leave you.” So they went on, <verse number="7" style="v" />and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan. Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river, and the fifty prophets stood a short distance away. <verse number="8" style="v" />Then Elijah took off his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it; the water divided, and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground. <verse number="9" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.9: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">Dt 21.17.</char></note> There, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken away.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />“That is a difficult request to grant,” Elijah replied. “But you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you; if you don't see me, you won't receive it.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />They kept talking as they walked on; then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them, and Elijah was taken up to heaven by a whirlwind. <verse number="12" style="v" /><note caller="-" style="x"><char style="xo" closed="false">2.12: </char><char style="xt" closed="false">2 K 13.14 </char><char style="xdc">; Si 48.9,12</char>.</note> Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah, “My father, my father! Mighty defender of Israel! You are gone!” And he never saw Elijah again.</para>
  <para style="p">In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two. <verse number="13" style="v" />Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. <verse number="14" style="v" />He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said, “Where is the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Elijah?” Then he struck the water again, and it divided, and he walked over to the other side. <verse number="15" style="v" />The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said, “The power of Elijah is on Elisha!” They went to meet him, bowed down before him, <verse number="16" style="v" />and said, “There are fifty of us here, all strong men. Let us go and look for your master. Maybe the spirit of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has carried him away and left him on some mountain or in some valley.”</para>
  <para style="p">“No, you must not go,” Elisha answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />But they insisted until he gave in and let them go. The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days, but didn't find him. <verse number="18" style="v" />Then they returned to Elisha, who had waited at Jericho, and he said to them, “Didn't I tell you not to go?”</para>
  <para style="s">Miracles of Elisha</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />Some men from Jericho went to Elisha and said, “As you know, sir, this is a fine city, but the water is bad and causes miscarriages.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />“Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me,” he ordered. They brought it to him, <verse number="21" style="v" />and he went to the spring, threw the salt in the water, and said, “This is what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> says: ‘I make this water pure, and it will not cause any more deaths or miscarriages.’” <verse number="22" style="v" />And that water has been pure ever since, just as Elisha said it would be.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel, and on the way some boys came out of a town and made fun of him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they shouted.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />Elisha turned around, glared at them, and cursed them in the name of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />Elisha went on to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="s">War between Israel and Moab</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twelve years. <verse number="2" style="v" />He sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, but he was not as bad as his father or his mother Jezebel; he pulled down the image his father had made for the worship of Baal. <verse number="3" style="v" />Yet, like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him, he led Israel into sin and would not stop.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, and every year he gave as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 sheep. <verse number="5" style="v" />But when King Ahab of Israel died, Mesha rebelled against Israel. <verse number="6" style="v" />At once King Joram left Samaria and gathered all his troops. <verse number="7" style="v" />He sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you join me in war against him?”</para>
  <para style="p">“I will,” King Jehoshaphat replied. “I am at your disposal, and so are my men and my horses. <verse number="8" style="v" />What route shall we take for the attack?”</para>
  <para style="p">“We will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom,” Joram answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />So King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom set out. After marching seven days, they ran out of water, and there was none left for the men or the pack animals. <verse number="10" style="v" />“We're done for!” King Joram exclaimed. “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> has put the three of us at the mercy of the king of Moab!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />King Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there a prophet here through whom we can consult the <char style="nd">Lord</char>?”</para>
  <para style="p">An officer of King Joram's forces answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was Elijah's assistant.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />“He is a true prophet,” King Jehoshaphat said. So the three kings went to Elisha.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />“Why should I help you?” Elisha said to the king of Israel. “Go and consult those prophets that your father and mother consulted.”</para>
  <para style="p">“No!” Joram replied. “It is the <char style="nd">Lord</char> who has put us three kings at the mercy of the king of Moab.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />Elisha answered, “By the living <char style="nd">Lord</char>, whom I serve, I swear that I would have nothing to do with you if I didn't respect your ally, King Jehoshaphat of Judah. <verse number="15" style="v" />Now get me a musician.”</para>
  <para style="p">As the musician played his harp, the power of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> came on Elisha, <verse number="16" style="v" />and he said, “This is what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> says: ‘Dig ditches all over this dry stream bed. <verse number="17" style="v" />Even though you will not see any rain or wind, this stream bed will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your pack animals will have plenty to drink.’” <verse number="18" style="v" />And Elisha continued, “But this is an easy thing for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> to do; he will also give you victory over the Moabites. <verse number="19" style="v" />You will conquer all their beautiful fortified cities; you will cut down all their fruit trees, stop all their springs, and ruin all their fertile fields by covering them with stones.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />The next morning, at the time of the regular morning sacrifice, water came flowing from the direction of Edom and covered the ground.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />When the Moabites heard that the three kings had come to attack them, all the men who could bear arms, from the oldest to the youngest, were called out and stationed at the border. <verse number="22" style="v" />When they got up the following morning, the sun was shining on the water, making it look as red as blood. <verse number="23" style="v" />“It's blood!” they exclaimed. “The three enemy armies must have fought and killed each other! Let's go and loot their camp!”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />But when they reached the camp, the Israelites attacked them and drove them back. The Israelites kept up the pursuit, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.24: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">kept up the pursuit; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew unclear.</char></note> slaughtering the Moabites <verse number="25" style="v" />and destroying their cities. As they passed by a fertile field, every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered; they also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees. At last only the capital city of Kir Heres <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.25: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Probable text </char><char style="fq" closed="false">only the capital city of Kir Heres; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew unclear.</char></note> was left, and the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />When the king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Syria, <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.26: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Syria; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Edom.</char></note> but he failed. <verse number="27" style="v" />So he took his oldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him on the city wall as a sacrifice to the god of Moab. The Israelites were terrified <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3.27: </char><char style="fk" closed="false">terrified: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">either because of what Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, might do, or because of what the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of the Israelites, might do.</char></note> and so they drew back from the city and returned to their own country.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="s">Elisha Helps a Poor Widow</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The widow of a member of a group of prophets went to Elisha and said, “Sir, my husband has died! As you know, he was a God-fearing man, but now a man he owed money to has come to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />“What shall I do for you?” he asked. “Tell me, what do you have at home?”</para>
  <para style="p">“Nothing at all, except a small jar of olive oil,” she answered.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />“Go to your neighbors and borrow as many empty jars as you can,” Elisha told her. <verse number="4" style="v" />“Then you and your sons go into the house, close the door, and start pouring oil into the jars. Set each one aside as soon as it is full.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />So the woman went into her house with her sons, closed the door, took the small jar of olive oil, and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her. <verse number="6" style="v" />When they had filled all the jars, she asked if there were any more. “That was the last one,” one of her sons answered. And the olive oil stopped flowing. <verse number="7" style="v" />She went back to Elisha, the prophet, who said to her, “Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts, and there will be enough money left over for you and your sons to live on.”</para>
  <para style="s">Elisha and the Rich Woman from Shunem</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />One day Elisha went to Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She invited him to a meal, and from then on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house. <verse number="9" style="v" />She said to her husband, “I am sure that this man who comes here so often is a holy man. <verse number="10" style="v" />Let's build a small room on the roof, put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in it, and he can stay there whenever he visits us.”</para>

He would cure him of his disease.” <verse number="4" style="v" />When Naaman heard of this, he went to the king and told him what the girl had said. <verse number="5" style="v" />The king said, “Go to the king of Israel and take this letter to him.”</para>
