    </note> Then Joshua sent two spies from the camp at Acacia with orders to go and secretly explore the land of Canaan, especially the city of Jericho. When they came to the city, they went to spend the night in the house of a prostitute named Rahab. <verse number="2" style="v" />The king of Jericho heard that some Israelites had come that night to spy out the country, <verse number="3" style="v" />so he sent word to Rahab: “The men in your house have come to spy out the whole country!

    <verse number="8" style="v" />Before the spies settled down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof <verse number="9" style="v" />and said to them, “I know that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has given you this land.

When they had gone, she tied the red cord to the window.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />The spies went into the hills and hid. The king's men looked for them all over the countryside for three days, but they did not find them, so they returned to Jericho. <verse number="23" style="v" />Then the two spies came down from the hills, crossed the river, and went back to Joshua.

  <para style="s">The People of Israel Cross the Jordan</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />The next morning Joshua and all the people of Israel got up early, left the camp at Acacia, and went to the Jordan, where they camped while waiting to cross it. <verse number="2" style="v" />Three days later the leaders went through the camp <verse number="3" style="v" />and told the people, “When you see the priests carrying the Covenant Box of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God, break camp and follow them. <verse number="4" style="v" />You have never been here before, so they will show you the way to go.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Joshua told the people, “Purify yourselves, because tomorrow the <char style="nd">Lord</char> will perform miracles among you.” <verse number="6" style="v" />Then he told the priests to take the Covenant Box and go with it ahead of the people.

    <verse number="14-15" style="v" />It was harvest time, and the river was in flood.</para>
  <para style="p">When the people left the camp to cross the Jordan, the priests went ahead of them, carrying the Covenant Box. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, <verse number="16" style="v" />the water stopped flowing and piled up, far upstream at Adam, the city beside Zarethan. The flow downstream to the Dead Sea was completely cut off, and the people were able to cross over near Jericho. <verse number="17" style="v" />While the people walked across on dry ground, the priests carrying the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s Covenant Box stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan until all the people had crossed over.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />The men followed Joshua's orders.

(Those stones are still there.) <verse number="10" style="v" />The priests stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything had been done that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> ordered Joshua to tell the people to do. This is what Moses had commanded.</para>
  <para style="p">The people hurried across the river. <verse number="11" style="v" />When they were all on the other side, the priests with the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s Covenant Box went on ahead of the people. <verse number="12" style="v" />The men of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and of half the tribe of Manasseh, ready for battle, crossed ahead of the rest of the people, as Moses had told them to do. <verse number="13" style="v" />In the presence of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> about forty thousand men ready for war crossed over to the plain near Jericho. <verse number="14" style="v" />What the <char style="nd">Lord</char> did that day made the people of Israel consider Joshua a great man. They honored him all his life, just as they had honored Moses.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> told Joshua <verse number="16" style="v" />to command the priests carrying the Covenant Box to come up out of the Jordan. <verse number="17" style="v" />Joshua did so, <verse number="18" style="v" />and when the priests reached the riverbank, the river began flowing once more and flooded its banks again.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho. <verse number="20" style="v" />There Joshua set up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan. <verse number="21" style="v" />And he said to the people of Israel, “In the future, when your children ask you what these stones mean, <verse number="22" style="v" />you will tell them about the time when Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground. <verse number="23" style="v" />Tell them that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God dried up the water of the Jordan for you until you had crossed, just as he dried up the Red Sea for us. <verse number="24" style="v" />Because of this everyone on earth will know how great the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s power is, and you will honor the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God forever.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s command to Israel not to take from Jericho anything that was to be destroyed was not obeyed.

    <verse number="2" style="v" />Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai, a city east of Bethel, near Bethaven, with orders to go and explore the land. When they had done so, <verse number="3" style="v" />they reported back to Joshua: “There is no need for everyone to attack Ai. Send only about two or three thousand men. Don't send the whole army up there to fight; it is not a large city.” <verse number="4" style="v" />So about three thousand Israelites made the attack, but they were forced to retreat. <verse number="5" style="v" />The men of Ai chased them from the city gate as far as some quarries and killed about thirty-six of them on the way down the hill. Then the Israelites lost their courage and were afraid.</para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" />Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief, threw themselves to the ground before the <char style="nd">Lord</char>'s Covenant Box, and lay there till evening, with dust on their heads to show their sorrow. <verse number="7" style="v" />And Joshua said, “Sovereign <char style="nd">Lord</char>! Why did you bring us across the Jordan at all? To turn us over to the Amorites? To destroy us? Why didn't we just stay on the other side of the Jordan? <verse number="8" style="v" />What can I say, O Lord, now that Israel has retreated from the enemy? <verse number="9" style="v" />The Canaanites and everyone else in the country will hear about it.

    <verse number="10" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you lying on the ground like this? <verse number="11" style="v" />Israel has sinned! They have broken the agreement with me that I ordered them to keep. They have taken some of the things condemned to destruction. They stole them, lied about it, and put them with their own things. <verse number="12" style="v" />This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They retreat from them because they themselves have now been condemned to destruction! I will not stay with you any longer unless you destroy the things you were ordered not to take! <verse number="13" style="v" />Get up! Purify the people and get them ready to come before me. Tell them to be ready tomorrow, because I, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> God of Israel, have this to say: ‘Israel, you have in your possession some things that I ordered you to destroy! You cannot stand against your enemies until you get rid of these things!’ <verse number="14" style="v" />So tell them that in the morning they will be brought forward, tribe by tribe. The tribe that I pick out will then come forward, clan by clan. The clan that I pick out will come forward, family by family. The family that I pick out will come forward, one by one. <verse number="15" style="v" />The one who is then picked out and found with the condemned goods will be burned, along with his family and everything he owns, for he has brought terrible shame on Israel and has broken my covenant.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Early the next morning Joshua brought Israel forward, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was picked out. <verse number="17" style="v" />He brought the tribe of Judah forward, clan by clan, and the clan of Zerah was picked out. Then he brought the clan of Zerah forward, family by family, and the family of Zabdi was picked out. <verse number="18" style="v" />He then brought Zabdi's family forward, one by one, and Achan, the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, was picked out. <verse number="19" style="v" />Joshua said to him, “My son, tell the truth here before the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me now what you have done. Don't try to hide it from me.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />“It's true,” Achan answered. “I have sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, Israel's God, and this is what I did. <verse number="21" style="v" />Among the things we seized I saw a beautiful Babylonian cloak, about five pounds of silver, and a bar of gold weighing over one pound. I wanted them so much that I took them. You will find them buried inside my tent, with the silver at the bottom.”</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />So Joshua sent some men, who ran to the tent and found that the condemned things really were buried there, with the silver at the bottom. <verse number="23" style="v" />They brought them out of the tent, took them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them down in the presence of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="24" style="v" />Joshua, along with all the people of Israel, seized Achan, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, together with Achan's sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned; and they took them to Trouble Valley. <verse number="25" style="v" />And Joshua said, “Why have you brought such trouble on us? The <char style="nd">Lord</char> will now bring trouble on you!” All the people then stoned Achan to death; they also stoned and burned his family and possessions. <verse number="26" style="v" />They put a huge pile of stones over him, which is there to this day.

    <verse number="1" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Take all the soldiers with you and go on up to Ai. Don't be afraid or discouraged. I will give you victory over the king of Ai; his people, city, and land will be yours. <verse number="2" style="v" />You are to do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king, but this time you may keep its goods and livestock for yourselves.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />So Joshua got ready to go to Ai with all his soldiers.

When the men of Ai come out against us, we will turn and run, just as we did the first time. <verse number="6" style="v" />They will pursue us until we have led them away from the city. They will think that we are running from them, as we did before. <verse number="7" style="v" />Then you will come out of hiding and capture the city. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God will give it to you. <verse number="8" style="v" />After you have taken the city, set it on fire, just as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has commanded. These are your orders.” <verse number="9" style="v" />So Joshua sent them out, and they went to their hiding place and waited there, west of Ai, between Ai and Bethel. Joshua spent the night in camp.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Early in the morning Joshua got up and called the soldiers together. Then he and the leaders of Israel led them to Ai. <verse number="11" style="v" />The soldiers with him went toward the main entrance to the city and set up camp on the north side, with a valley between themselves and Ai. <verse number="12" style="v" />He took about five thousand men and put them in hiding west of the city, between Ai and Bethel. <verse number="13" style="v" />The soldiers were arranged for battle with the main camp north of the city and the rest of the men to the west. Joshua spent the night in the valley. <verse number="14" style="v" />When the king of Ai saw Joshua's men, he acted quickly. He and all his men went out toward the Jordan Valley to fight the Israelites at the same place as before, not knowing that he was about to be attacked from the rear. <verse number="15" style="v" />Joshua and his men pretended that they were retreating, and ran away toward the barren country. <verse number="16" style="v" />All the men in the city had been called together to go after them, and as they pursued Joshua, they kept getting farther away from the city. <verse number="17" style="v" />Every man in Ai <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">8.17: </char><char style="ft" closed="false">One ancient translation </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Ai; </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Hebrew </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Ai and Bethel.</char></note> went after the Israelites, and the city was left wide open, with no one to defend it.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Point your spear at Ai; I am giving it to you.” Joshua did as he was told, <verse number="19" style="v" />and as soon as he lifted his hand, the men who had been hiding got up quickly, ran into the city and captured it. They immediately set the city on fire. <verse number="20" style="v" />When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke rising to the sky. There was no way for them to escape, because the Israelites who had run toward the barren country now turned around to attack them. <verse number="21" style="v" />When Joshua and his men saw that the others had taken the city and that it was on fire, they turned around and began killing the men of Ai. <verse number="22" style="v" />The Israelites in the city now came down to join the battle. So the men of Ai found themselves completely surrounded by Israelites, and they were all killed. No one got away, and no one lived through it <verse number="23" style="v" />except the king of Ai. He was captured and taken to Joshua.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />The Israelites killed every one of the enemy in the barren country where they had chased them. Then they went back to Ai and killed everyone there. <verse number="25-26" style="v" />Joshua kept his spear pointed at Ai and did not put it down until every person there had been killed. The whole population of Ai was killed that day—twelve thousand men and women. <verse number="27" style="v" />The Israelites kept for themselves the livestock and goods captured in the city, as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had told Joshua. <verse number="28" style="v" />Joshua burned Ai and left it in ruins. It is still like that today. <verse number="29" style="v" />He hanged the king of Ai from a tree and left his body there until evening. At sundown Joshua gave orders for the body to be removed, and it was thrown down at the entrance to the city gate. They covered it with a huge pile of stones, which is still there today.</para>
