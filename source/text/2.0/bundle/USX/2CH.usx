    <verse number="1" style="v" />King Solomon decided to build a temple where the <char style="nd">Lord</char> would be worshiped, and also to build a palace for himself. <verse number="2" style="v" />He put 70,000 men to work transporting materials, and 80,000 to work cutting stone in the hill country.

It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices, where we will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously, and where we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other holy days honoring the <char style="nd">Lord</char> our God.

He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected. <verse number="8" style="v" />I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours <verse number="9" style="v" />in preparing large quantities of timber, because this temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent. <verse number="10" style="v" />As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you 100,000 bushels of wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil.”</para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" />King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply.

He knows how to make things out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood. He can work with blue, purple, and red cloth, and with linen. He can do all sorts of engraving and can follow any design suggested to him. Let him work with your skilled workers and with those who worked for your father, King David. <verse number="15" style="v" />So now send us the wheat, barley, wine, and olive oil that you promised. <verse number="16" style="v" />In the mountains of Lebanon we will cut down all the cedars you need, tie them together in rafts, and float them by sea as far as Joppa.

    </note> Because King Ahaz sinned, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> his God let the king of Syria defeat him and take a large number of Judeans back to Damascus as prisoners. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> also let the king of Israel, Pekah son of Remaliah, defeat Ahaz and kill 120,000 of the bravest Judean soldiers in one day. The <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of their ancestors, permitted this to happen, because the people of Judah had abandoned him. <verse number="7" style="v" />An Israelite soldier named Zichri killed King Ahaz' son Maaseiah, the palace administrator Azrikam, and Elkanah, who was second in command to the king. <verse number="8" style="v" />Even though the Judeans were their own relatives, the Israelite army captured 200,000 women and children as prisoners and took them back to Samaria, along with large amounts of loot.</para>

    <verse number="9" style="v" />A man named Oded, a prophet of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, lived in the city of Samaria. He met the returning Israelite army with its Judean prisoners as it was about to enter the city, and he said, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> God of your ancestors was angry with Judah and let you defeat them, but now he has heard of the vicious way you slaughtered them. <verse number="10" style="v" />And now you intend to make the men and women of Jerusalem and Judah your slaves. Don't you know that you also have committed sins against the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God? <verse number="11" style="v" />Listen to me! These prisoners are your brothers and sisters. Let them go, or the <char style="nd">Lord</char> will punish you in his anger.”</para>

    <verse number="12" style="v" />Four of the leading men of the Northern Kingdom, Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai also opposed the actions of the army. <verse number="13" style="v" />They said, “Don't bring those prisoners here! We have already sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and made him angry enough to punish us. Now you want to do something that will increase our guilt.” <verse number="14" style="v" />So then the army handed the prisoners and the loot over to the people and their leaders, <verse number="15" style="v" />and the four men were appointed to provide the prisoners with clothing from the captured loot. They gave them clothes and sandals to wear, gave them enough to eat and drink, and put olive oil on their wounds. Those who were too weak to walk were put on donkeys, and all the prisoners were taken back to Judean territory at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then the Israelites returned home to Samaria.</para>

The Levites gave the blood of the sacrifices to the priests, who sprinkled it on the altar. <verse number="17" style="v" />Because many of the people were not ritually clean, they could not kill the Passover lambs, so the Levites did it for them and dedicated the lambs to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="18" style="v" />In addition, many of those who had come from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not performed the ritual of purification, and so they were observing Passover improperly.
