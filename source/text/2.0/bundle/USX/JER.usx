  <para style="ip">The prophet Jeremiah lived during the latter part of the seventh century and the first part of the sixth century <char style="sc">b.c.</char> During his long ministry he warned God's people of the catastrophe that was to fall upon the nation because of their idolatry and sin. He lived to see this prediction come true with the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of the city and the Temple, and the exile to Babylonia of Judah's king and many of the people. He also foretold the eventual return of the people from exile and the restoration of the nation.</para>
  <para style="ip">
    <char style="bk">The Book of Jeremiah</char> may be divided into the following parts: (1) The call of Jeremiah. (2) Messages from God to the nation of Judah and its rulers during the reigns of Josiah, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah. (3) Material from the memoirs of Baruch, Jeremiah's secretary, including various prophecies and important events from the life of Jeremiah. (4) Messages from the Lord about various foreign nations. (5) A historical appendix, giving an account of the fall of Jerusalem, and the exile to Babylonia.</para>
  <para style="ip">Jeremiah was a sensitive man who deeply loved his people, and who hated to have to pronounce judgment upon them. In many passages he spoke with deep emotion about the things he suffered because God had called him to be a prophet. The word of the Lord was like fire in his heart–he could not keep it back.</para>
  <para style="ip">Some of the greatest words in the book point beyond Jeremiah's own troubled time to the day when there would be a new covenant, one that God's people would keep without a teacher to remind them, because it would be written on their hearts (31.31-34).</para>

    <verse number="4" style="v" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to me, <verse number="5" style="v" />“I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations.”</para>

    <verse number="9" style="v" />Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> reached out, touched my lips, and said to me, “Listen, I am giving you the words you must speak. <verse number="10" style="v" />Today I give you authority over nations and kingdoms to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />He said to me, “Destruction will boil over from the north on all who live in this land, <verse number="15" style="v" />because I am calling all the nations in the north to come. Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem and around its walls and also around the other cities of Judah. <verse number="16" style="v" />I will punish my people because they have sinned; they have abandoned me, have offered sacrifices to other gods, and have made idols and worshiped them. <verse number="17" style="v" />Get ready, Jeremiah; go and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them now, or I will make you even more afraid when you are with them. <verse number="18-19" style="v" />Listen, Jeremiah! Everyone in this land—the kings of Judah, the officials, the priests, and the people—will be against you. But today I am giving you the strength to resist them; you will be like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. They will not defeat you, for I will be with you to protect you.
